<h1>SDKBOX for Cocos</h1>

##Overview
SDKBOX support ALL the recent versions (v3.0 +) for Cocos/Cocos2d-x game engine, including  C++, Javascript and Lua.


##Integration
You can install SDKBOX plugins using one of these three methods.


### By SDKBOX CLI Installer
SDKBOX Installer is an optional command line tool for any version of cocos2d-x projects, including v3.x. It lets you integrate SDK plugins by a single line of command. ([Learn more](http://docs.sdkbox.com/en/installer/))


### From Cocos Creator
We are working on a plugin for Creator which will allow you to integrate SDKBOX plugins directly from UI. For now, you can still use SDKBOX installer. ([Learn more](qa/integration-admob-to-creator.md))


### By installing manually
If you prefer to see exactly which libraries and assets are needed for a integration, you can download the plugin bundle file. A bundle packages everything including SDK libs, instructions, and sample codes. You can download the bundle files from [the SDKBOX Plugins page](http://sdkbox.com).


!!! note
    After integration, please make sure to check out each plugin's individual documentation for the detail information about updateing settings and calling APIs from your game.
