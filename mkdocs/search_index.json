This tag is\noptional on newer SDK versions and doesn't work on version 2.3.3.\n\n\nandroid:hardwareAccelerated=\ntrue\n /\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nAndroid.mk\n\n\nEdit \nproject_root\n/jni/Android.mk\n to:\n\n\nAdd additional requirements to \nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES\n:\n\n\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += PluginAchievement\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += sdkbox\n\n\n\n\nAdd a call to:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n\n\n\n\nbefore any \nimport-module\n statements.\n\n\nAdd additional \nimport-module\n statements at the end:\n\n\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginachievement)\n\n\n\n\nThis means that your ordering should look similar to this:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginachievement)\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n It is important to make sure these statements are above the existing \n$(call import-module,./prebuilt-mk)\n statement, if you are using the pre-built libraries.\n\n\nModify \nApplication.mk\n (Cocos2d-x v3.0 to v3.2 only)\n\n\nEdit \nproject_root\n/jni/Application.mk\n to make sure \nAPP_STL\n is defined\ncorrectly. If \nApplication.mk\n contains \nAPP_STL := c++_static\n, it should be\nchanged to:\n\n\nAPP_STL := gnustl_static\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using cocos2d-x from source, assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/\nlib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using the prebuilt cocos2d-x libraries assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n./src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n When using Cocos2d-x from source, different versions have \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n in a different location. One way to find the location is to look in \nproj.android/project.properties\n. Example:\n  \nandroid.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java\n\n\nIn this case, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n should be located at:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to add the following imports:\n\n\n\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, modify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to edit the \nonCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)\n function to add a call to \nSDKBox.init(this);\n. The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to \nonLoadNativeLibraries();\n. Example:\n\n\n\n\nonLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code. There are a few rules here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has not been defined, \nadd it\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has been defined, add the calls to \nSDKBox\n in the \nsame\n existing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nProguard (optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file. Example:\n\n\n\n\nproguard.config=${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt:proguard-project.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the file you specified to include the following:\n\n\n\n\n# cocos2d-x\n-keep public class org.cocos2dx.** { *; }\n-dontwarn org.cocos2dx.**\n-keep public class com.chukong.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.chukong.**\n\n# google play service\n-keep class com.google.android.gms.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.google.android.gms.**\n\n-keep class * extends java.util.ListResourceBundle {\n    protected Object[][] getContents();\n}\n\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.common.internal.safeparcel.SafeParcelable {\n    public static final *** NULL;\n}\n\n-keepnames @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName class *\n-keepclassmembernames class * {\n    @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName *;\n}\n\n-keepnames class * implements android.os.Parcelable {\n    public static final ** CREATOR;\n}\n\n#sdkbox\n-keep class com.sdkbox.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.sdkbox.**\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Proguard only works with \nRelease\n builds (i.e \ncocos run -m release\n) debug builds do not invoke Proguard rules.",

One way to find the location is to look in  proj.android/project.properties . Example:\n   android.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java  In this case,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  should be located at:  ../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java   Modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to add the following imports:   import android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;   Second, modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to edit the  onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)  function to add a call to  SDKBox.init(this); .

If \nApplication.mk\n contains \nAPP_STL := c++_static\n, it should be\nchanged to:\n\n\nAPP_STL := gnustl_static\n\n\n\n\nCopy all source and header files from \nplugin/luabindings/\n to your projects \nClasses\n folder.\n\n\nAdd all \n.cpp\n files, that you just copied, to \nAndroid.mk\n in the \nLOCAL_SRC_FILES\n section. Example\n\n\nLOCAL_SRC_FILES := hellocpp/main.cpp \\\n                ../../Classes/AppDelegate.cpp \\\n                ../../Classes/HelloWorldScene.cpp \\\n                                ../../Classes/NewSourceFile.cpp\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using cocos2d-x from source, assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/\nlib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using the prebuilt cocos2d-x libraries assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n./src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n When using Cocos2d-x from source, different versions have \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n in a different location. One way to find the location is to look in \nproj.android/project.properties\n. Example:\n  \nandroid.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java\n\n\nIn this case, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n should be located at:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to add the following imports:\n\n\n\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, modify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to edit the \nonCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)\n function to add a call to \nSDKBox.init(this);\n. The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to \nonLoadNativeLibraries();\n. Example:\n\n\n\n\nonLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code. There are a few rules here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has not been defined, \nadd it\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has been defined, add the calls to \nSDKBox\n in the \nsame\n existing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nProguard (optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file. Example:\n\n\n\n\nproguard.config=${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt:proguard-project.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the file you specified to include the following:\n\n\n\n\n# adcolony\n-dontwarn android.webkit.**\n\n-dontwarn com.jirbo.adcolony.**\n-keep public class com.jirbo.adcolony.** { public *; }\n\n\n# cocos2d-x\n-keep public class org.cocos2dx.** { *; }\n-dontwarn org.cocos2dx.**\n-keep public class com.chukong.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.chukong.**\n\n# google play service\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.** { public *; }\n-dontwarn com.google.android.gms.**\n\n-keep class * extends java.util.ListResourceBundle {\n    protected Object[][] getContents();\n}\n\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.common.internal.safeparcel.SafeParcelable {\n    public static final *** NULL;\n}\n\n-keepnames @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName class *\n-keepclassmembernames class * {\n    @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName *;\n}\n\n-keepnames class * implements android.os.Parcelable {\n    public static final ** CREATOR;\n}\n\n#sdkbox\n-keep public class com.sdkbox.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.sdkbox.**\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Proguard only works with \nRelease\n builds (i.e \ncocos run -m release\n) debug builds do not invoke Proguard rules.",

Add additional  import-module  statements at the end:  $(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginadcolony)  This means that your ordering should look similar to this:  $(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginadcolony)  Note:  It is important to make sure these statements are above the existing  $(call import-module,./prebuilt-mk)  statement, if you are using the pre-built libraries.  Modify  Application.mk  (Cocos2d-x v3.0 to v3.2 only)  Edit  project_root /jni/Application.mk  to make sure  APP_STL  is defined\ncorrectly. If  Application.mk  contains  APP_STL := c++_static , it should be\nchanged to:  APP_STL := gnustl_static  Copy all source and header files from  plugin/luabindings/  to your projects  Classes  folder.

One way to find the location is to look in  proj.android/project.properties . Example:\n   android.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java  In this case,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  should be located at:  ../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java   Modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to add the following imports:   import android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;   Second, modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to edit the  onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)  function to add a call to  SDKBox.init(this); . The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to  onLoadNativeLibraries(); . Example:   onLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);    Last, we need to insert the proper  overrides  code. There are a few rules here.    If the method listed has not been defined,  add it .

Add additional  import-module  statements at the end:  $(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginagecheq)  This means that your ordering should look similar to this:  $(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginagecheq)  Note:  It is important to make sure these statements are above the existing  $(call import-module,./prebuilt-mk)  statement, if you are using the pre-built libraries.  Modify  Application.mk  (Cocos2d-x v3.0 to v3.2 only)  Edit  project_root /jni/Application.mk  to make sure  APP_STL  is defined\ncorrectly.

One way to find the location is to look in  proj.android/project.properties . Example:\n   android.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java  In this case,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  should be located at:  ../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java   Modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to add the following imports:   import android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;   Second, modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to edit the  onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)  function to add a call to  SDKBox.init(this); . The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to  onLoadNativeLibraries(); . Example:   onLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);    Last, we need to insert the proper  overrides  code. There are a few rules here.    If the method listed has not been defined,  add it .

\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES\n:\n\n\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += PluginAppodeal\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += sdkbox\n\n\n\n\nAdd a call to:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n\n\n\n\nbefore any \nimport-module\n statements.\n\n\nAdd additional \nimport-module\n statements at the end:\n\n\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginappodeal)\n\n\n\n\nThis means that your ordering should look similar to this:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginappodeal)\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n It is important to make sure these statements are above the existing \n$(call import-module,./prebuilt-mk)\n statement, if you are using the pre-built libraries.\n\n\nModify \nApplication.mk\n (Cocos2d-x v3.0 to v3.2 only)\n\n\nEdit \nproject_root\n/jni/Application.mk\n to make sure \nAPP_STL\n is defined\ncorrectly. If \nApplication.mk\n contains \nAPP_STL := c++_static\n, it should be\nchanged to:\n\n\nAPP_STL := gnustl_static\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using cocos2d-x from source, assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/\nlib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using the prebuilt cocos2d-x libraries assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n./src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n When using Cocos2d-x from source, different versions have \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n in a different location. One way to find the location is to look in \nproj.android/project.properties\n. Example:\n  \nandroid.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java\n\n\nIn this case, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n should be located at:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to add the following imports:\n\n\n\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, modify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to edit the \nonCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)\n function to add a call to \nSDKBox.init(this);\n. The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to \nonLoadNativeLibraries();\n. Example:\n\n\n\n\nonLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code. There are a few rules here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has not been defined, \nadd it\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has been defined, add the calls to \nSDKBox\n in the \nsame\n existing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nProguard (optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file.

You may need to add the required entry to the \ninfo.plist\n, under \nLSApplicationQueriesSchemes\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON Configuration\n\n\nSDKBOX Installer will automatically inject a sample configuration to your \nres/sdkbox_config.json\n, that you have to modify it before you can use it for your own app\n\n\nHere is an example of the Appodeal configuration, you need to replace \napp_key\n items with your specific \nAppodeal Key\n account information.\n\n\nAppodeal\n:{\n    \napp_key\n:\n2cfc9cc638980eb7f5ff35d6eb63dbe404503151ccc451ed\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nRegister Javascript Functions\n\n\nYou need to register all the Appodeal JS functions with cocos2d-x before using them.\n\n\nTo do this:\n* Modify \n./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp\n to include the following headers:\n\n\n#include \nPluginAppodealJS.hpp\n\n#include \nPluginAppodealJSHelper.h\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \n./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp\n make sure to call:\n\n\n\n\nsc-\naddRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginAppodealJS);\nsc-\naddRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginAppodealJS_helper);\n\n\n\n\nInitialize Appodeal\n\n\nInitialize the plugin by calling \ninit()\n where appropriate in your code. We\nrecommend to do this in the \napp.js\n. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.init();\n\n\n\n\nUsing Appodeal\n\n\nAfter initialization you can begin to use the Appodeal functionality:\n\n\nplugin.setUserVkId(\nuser id\n);\nplugin.cacheAd(15);\n\n\n\n\nCatch Appodeal events (optional)\n\n\nThis allows you to catch the \nAppodeal\n events so that you can perform operations based upon responses. A simple example might look like this:\n\n\nvar plugin = sdkbox.PluginAppodeal\nplugin.setListener({\n    onBannerDidLoadAd: function() { cc.log(\nonBannerDidLoadAd\n) },\n    onBannerDidFailToLoadAd: function() { cc.log(\nonBannerDidFailToLoadAd\n) },\n    onBannerDidClick: function() { cc.log(\nonBannerDidClick\n) },\n    onBannerPresent: function() { cc.log(\nonBannerPresent\n) },\n    onInterstitialDidLoadAd: function() { cc.log(\nonInterstitialDidLoadAd\n) },\n    onInterstitialDidFailToLoadAd: function() { cc.log(\nonInterstitialDidFailToLoadAd\n) },\n    onInterstitialWillPresent: function() { cc.log(\nonInterstitialWillPresent\n) },\n    onInterstitialDidDismiss: function() { cc.log(\nonInterstitialDidDismiss\n) },\n    onInterstitialDidClick: function() { cc.log(\nonInterstitialDidClick\n) },\n    onVideoDidLoadAd: function() { cc.log(\nonVideoDidLoadAd\n) },\n    onVideoDidFailToLoadAd: function() { cc.log(\nonVideoDidFailToLoadAd\n) },\n    onVideoDidPresent: function() { cc.log(\nonVideoDidPresent\n) },\n    onVideoWillDismiss: function() { cc.log(\nonVideoWillDismiss\n) },\n    onVideoDidFinish: function() { cc.log(\nonVideoDidFinish\n) }\n})\nplugin.init()\n\n\n\n\nAPI Reference\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.init();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitialize the plugin instance.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.setListener(listener);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet listener to listen for Appodeal events\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.setDebugEnabled(debugEnabled);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.showAd(style);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.cacheAd(type);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.hideBanner();\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.isReadyForShowWithStyle(showStyle);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.setUserVkId(vkId);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.setUserFacebookId(facebookId);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.setUserEmail(email);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.setUserBirthday(birthday);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.setUserAge(age);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.setUserGender(gender);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.setUserOccupation(occupation);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.setUserRelationship(relationship);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.setUserSmokingAttitude(smokingAttitude);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.setUserAlcoholAttitude(alcoholAttitude);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.setUserInterests(interests);\n\n\n\n\nListeners\n\n\nonBannerDidLoadAd();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when banner ad load\n\n\n\n\nonBannerDidFailToLoadAd();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when banner ad fail to load\n\n\n\n\nonBannerDidClick();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when banner ad clicked\n\n\n\n\nonBannerPresent();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when banner ad present\n\n\n\n\nonInterstitialDidLoadAd();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when interstitial ad load\n\n\n\n\nonInterstitialDidFailToLoadAd();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when interstitial ad fail to load\n\n\n\n\nonInterstitialWillPresent();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when interstitial ad present\n\n\n\n\nonInterstitialDidDismiss();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when interstitial dismiss\n\n\n\n\nonInterstitialDidClick();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when interstitial ad clicked\n\n\n\n\nonVideoDidLoadAd();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when video load\n\n\n\n\nonVideoDidFailToLoadAd();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when video fail to load\n\n\n\n\nonVideoDidPresent();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when video present\n\n\n\n\nonVideoWillDismiss();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when video dismiss\n\n\n\n\nonVideoDidFinish();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when video finish\n\n\n\n\nManual Integration\n\n\nIf the \nSDKBOX Installer\n \nfails\n to complete successfully, it is possible to integrate SDKBOX manually.

\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES\n:\n\n\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += PluginAppodeal\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += sdkbox\n\n\n\n\nAdd a call to:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n\n\n\n\nbefore any \nimport-module\n statements.\n\n\nAdd additional \nimport-module\n statements at the end:\n\n\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginappodeal)\n\n\n\n\nThis means that your ordering should look similar to this:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginappodeal)\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n It is important to make sure these statements are above the existing \n$(call import-module,./prebuilt-mk)\n statement, if you are using the pre-built libraries.\n\n\nModify \nApplication.mk\n (Cocos2d-x v3.0 to v3.2 only)\n\n\nEdit \nproject_root\n/jni/Application.mk\n to make sure \nAPP_STL\n is defined\ncorrectly. If \nApplication.mk\n contains \nAPP_STL := c++_static\n, it should be\nchanged to:\n\n\nAPP_STL := gnustl_static\n\n\n\n\nCopy all source and header files from \nplugin/jsbindings/\n to your projects \nClasses\n folder.\n\n\nAdd all \n.cpp\n files, that you just copied, to \nAndroid.mk\n in the \nLOCAL_SRC_FILES\n section. Example\n\n\nLOCAL_SRC_FILES := hellocpp/main.cpp \\\n                  ../../Classes/AppDelegate.cpp \\\n                  ../../Classes/HelloWorldScene.cpp \\\n                                    ../../Classes/NewSourceFile.cpp\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using cocos2d-x from source, assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/\nlib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using the prebuilt cocos2d-x libraries assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n./src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n When using Cocos2d-x from source, different versions have \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n in a different location. One way to find the location is to look in \nproj.android/project.properties\n. Example:\n  \nandroid.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java\n\n\nIn this case, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n should be located at:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to add the following imports:\n\n\n\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, modify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to edit the \nonCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)\n function to add a call to \nSDKBox.init(this);\n. The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to \nonLoadNativeLibraries();\n. Example:\n\n\n\n\nonLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code. There are a few rules here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has not been defined, \nadd it\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has been defined, add the calls to \nSDKBox\n in the \nsame\n existing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nProguard (optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file.

To do this:\n* Modify  ./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp  to include the following headers:  #include  PluginAppodealJS.hpp \n#include  PluginAppodealJSHelper.h    Modify  ./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp  make sure to call:   sc- addRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginAppodealJS);\nsc- addRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginAppodealJS_helper);  Initialize Appodeal  Initialize the plugin by calling  init()  where appropriate in your code. We\nrecommend to do this in the  app.js . Example:  sdkbox.PluginAppodeal.init();  Using Appodeal  After initialization you can begin to use the Appodeal functionality:  plugin.setUserVkId( user id );\nplugin.cacheAd(15);  Catch Appodeal events (optional)  This allows you to catch the  Appodeal  events so that you can perform operations based upon responses. A simple example might look like this:  var plugin = sdkbox.PluginAppodeal\nplugin.setListener({\n    onBannerDidLoadAd: function() { cc.log( onBannerDidLoadAd ) },\n    onBannerDidFailToLoadAd: function() { cc.log( onBannerDidFailToLoadAd ) },\n    onBannerDidClick: function() { cc.log( onBannerDidClick ) },\n    onBannerPresent: function() { cc.log( onBannerPresent ) },\n    onInterstitialDidLoadAd: function() { cc.log( onInterstitialDidLoadAd ) },\n    onInterstitialDidFailToLoadAd: function() { cc.log( onInterstitialDidFailToLoadAd ) },\n    onInterstitialWillPresent: function() { cc.log( onInterstitialWillPresent ) },\n    onInterstitialDidDismiss: function() { cc.log( onInterstitialDidDismiss ) },\n    onInterstitialDidClick: function() { cc.log( onInterstitialDidClick ) },\n    onVideoDidLoadAd: function() { cc.log( onVideoDidLoadAd ) },\n    onVideoDidFailToLoadAd: function() { cc.log( onVideoDidFailToLoadAd ) },\n    onVideoDidPresent: function() { cc.log( onVideoDidPresent ) },\n    onVideoWillDismiss: function() { cc.log( onVideoWillDismiss ) },\n    onVideoDidFinish: function() { cc.log( onVideoDidFinish ) }\n})\nplugin.init()",

\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES\n:\n\n\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += PluginAppodeal\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += sdkbox\n\n\n\n\nAdd a call to:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n\n\n\n\nbefore any \nimport-module\n statements.\n\n\nAdd additional \nimport-module\n statements at the end:\n\n\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginappodeal)\n\n\n\n\nThis means that your ordering should look similar to this:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginappodeal)\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n It is important to make sure these statements are above the existing \n$(call import-module,./prebuilt-mk)\n statement, if you are using the pre-built libraries.\n\n\nModify \nApplication.mk\n (Cocos2d-x v3.0 to v3.2 only)\n\n\nEdit \nproject_root\n/jni/Application.mk\n to make sure \nAPP_STL\n is defined\ncorrectly. If \nApplication.mk\n contains \nAPP_STL := c++_static\n, it should be\nchanged to:\n\n\nAPP_STL := gnustl_static\n\n\n\n\nCopy all source and header files from \nplugin/luabindings/\n to your projects \nClasses\n folder.\n\n\nAdd all \n.cpp\n files, that you just copied, to \nAndroid.mk\n in the \nLOCAL_SRC_FILES\n section. Example\n\n\nLOCAL_SRC_FILES := hellocpp/main.cpp \\\n                ../../Classes/AppDelegate.cpp \\\n                ../../Classes/HelloWorldScene.cpp \\\n                                ../../Classes/NewSourceFile.cpp\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using cocos2d-x from source, assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/\nlib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using the prebuilt cocos2d-x libraries assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n./src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n When using Cocos2d-x from source, different versions have \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n in a different location. One way to find the location is to look in \nproj.android/project.properties\n. Example:\n  \nandroid.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java\n\n\nIn this case, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n should be located at:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to add the following imports:\n\n\n\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, modify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to edit the \nonCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)\n function to add a call to \nSDKBox.init(this);\n. The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to \nonLoadNativeLibraries();\n. Example:\n\n\n\n\nonLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code. There are a few rules here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has not been defined, \nadd it\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has been defined, add the calls to \nSDKBox\n in the \nsame\n existing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nProguard (optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file.

Add additional  import-module  statements at the end:  $(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginappodeal)  This means that your ordering should look similar to this:  $(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginappodeal)  Note:  It is important to make sure these statements are above the existing  $(call import-module,./prebuilt-mk)  statement, if you are using the pre-built libraries.  Modify  Application.mk  (Cocos2d-x v3.0 to v3.2 only)  Edit  project_root /jni/Application.mk  to make sure  APP_STL  is defined\ncorrectly. If  Application.mk  contains  APP_STL := c++_static , it should be\nchanged to:  APP_STL := gnustl_static  Copy all source and header files from  plugin/luabindings/  to your projects  Classes  folder.

One way to find the location is to look in  proj.android/project.properties . Example:\n   android.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java  In this case,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  should be located at:  ../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java   Modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to add the following imports:   import android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;   Second, modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to edit the  onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)  function to add a call to  SDKBox.init(this); . The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to  onLoadNativeLibraries(); . Example:   onLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);    Last, we need to insert the proper  overrides  code. There are a few rules here.    If the method listed has not been defined,  add it .    If the method listed has been defined, add the calls to  SDKBox  in the  same  existing function.          @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }",

If you use \nAppodeal\n, then you cannot also use the \nFlurry Analytics\n and \nChartboost\n services, in the same project.\n\n\n\n\nIntegration\n\n\nOpen a terminal and use the following command to install the SDKBOX Appodeal plugin. Make sure you setup the SDKBOX installer correctly.\n\n\n$ sdkbox import appodeal\n\n\n\n\nImportant Notice\n\n\nIf you upgraded to Xcode7 you need to perform the following steps to your project for plugin to function correctly.\n\n\nDisable App Transport Security\n\n\nAdding the following entry to the plist:\n\n\nkey\nNSAppTransportSecurity\n/key\n\n\ndict\n\n    \nkey\nNSAllowsArbitraryLoads\n/key\n\n    \ntrue/\n\n\n/dict\n\n\n\n\n\nDisable Bitcode support\n\n\nYou have to turn off \nBitcode\n support. If you don't cocos2d-x will fail to build.\n\n\nSet your game requires full screen\n\n\nIf your game doesn't support all screen orientations you will need to check \nRequires full screen\n in Xcode. If you do not, your app will fail Apple's submission process.\n\n\nWhitelist canOpenURL function\n\n\nThis depends on what plugins are in your project. You may need to add the required entry to the \ninfo.plist\n, under \nLSApplicationQueriesSchemes\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON Configuration\n\n\nSDKBOX Installer will automatically inject a sample configuration to your \nres/sdkbox_config.json\n, that you have to modify it before you can use it for your own app\n\n\nHere is an example of the Appodeal configuration, you need to replace \napp_key\n items with your specific \nAppodeal Key\n account information.\n\n\nAppodeal\n:{\n    \napp_key\n:\n2cfc9cc638980eb7f5ff35d6eb63dbe404503151ccc451ed\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nInitialize Appodeal\n\n\nInitialize the plugin where appropriate in your code. We recommend to do this in the \nAppDelegate::applicationDidFinishLaunching()\n or \nAppController:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions()\n. Make sure to include the appropriate headers:\n\n\n#include \nPluginAppodeal/PluginAppodeal.h\n\nAppDelegate::applicationDidFinishLaunching()\n{\n     sdkbox::PluginAppodeal::init();\n}\n\n\n\n\nUsing Appodeal\n\n\nAfter initialization you can begin to use the Appodeal functionality:\n\n\n// set user id\nsdkbox::PluginAppodeal::setUserVkId(\nuser id\n);\n// cache all type ad\nsdkbox::PluginAppodeal::cacheAd(sdkbox::PluginAppodeal::AdType::AppodealAdTypeAll);\n//show interstitial ad\nsdkbox::PluginAppodeal::showAd(sdkbox::PluginAppodeal::ShowStyle::AppodealShowStyleInterstitial);\n\n\n\n\nCatch Appodeal events (optional)\n\n\nThis allows you to catch the \nAppodeal\n events so that you can perform operations based upon responses.

            "text": "Appodeal\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\n\n\nCertain SDKBOX plugins do not work together. If you use \nAppodeal\n, then you cannot also use the \nFlurry Analytics\n and \nChartboost\n services, in the same project.\n\n\n\n\nIntegration\n\n\nOpen a terminal and use the following command to install the SDKBOX Appodeal plugin. Make sure you setup the SDKBOX installer correctly.\n\n\n$ sdkbox import appodeal\n\n\n\n\nImportant Notice\n\n\nIf you upgraded to Xcode7 you need to perform the following steps to your project for plugin to function correctly.\n\n\nDisable App Transport Security\n\n\nAdding the following entry to the plist:\n\n\nkey\nNSAppTransportSecurity\n/key\n\n\ndict\n\n    \nkey\nNSAllowsArbitraryLoads\n/key\n\n    \ntrue/\n\n\n/dict\n\n\n\n\n\nDisable Bitcode support\n\n\nYou have to turn off \nBitcode\n support. If you don't cocos2d-x will fail to build.\n\n\nSet your game requires full screen\n\n\nIf your game doesn't support all screen orientations you will need to check \nRequires full screen\n in Xcode. If you do not, your app will fail Apple's submission process.\n\n\nWhitelist canOpenURL function\n\n\nThis depends on what plugins are in your project. You may need to add the required entry to the \ninfo.plist\n, under \nLSApplicationQueriesSchemes\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON Configuration\n\n\nSDKBOX Installer will automatically inject a sample configuration to your \nres/sdkbox_config.json\n, that you have to modify it before you can use it for your own app\n\n\nHere is an example of the Appodeal configuration, you need to replace \napp_key\n items with your specific \nAppodeal Key\n account information.\n\n\nAppodeal\n:{\n    \napp_key\n:\n2cfc9cc638980eb7f5ff35d6eb63dbe404503151ccc451ed\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nRegister Javascript Functions\n\n\nYou need to register all the Appodeal JS functions with cocos2d-x before using them.\n\n\nTo do this:\n* Modify \n./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp\n to include the following headers:\n\n\n#include \nPluginAppodealJS.hpp\n\n#include \nPluginAppodealJSHelper.h\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \n./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp\n make sure to call:\n\n\n\n\nsc-\naddRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginAppodealJS);\nsc-\naddRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginAppodealJS_helper);\n\n\n\n\nInitialize Appodeal\n\n\nInitialize the plugin by calling \ninit()\n where appropriate in your code. We\nrecommend to do this in the \napp.js\n. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.init();\n\n\n\n\nUsing Appodeal\n\n\nAfter initialization you can begin to use the Appodeal functionality:\n\n\nplugin.setUserVkId(\nuser id\n);\nplugin.cacheAd(15);\n\n\n\n\nCatch Appodeal events (optional)\n\n\nThis allows you to catch the \nAppodeal\n events so that you can perform operations based upon responses. A simple example might look like this:\n\n\nvar plugin = sdkbox.PluginAppodeal\nplugin.setListener({\n    onBannerDidLoadAd: function() { cc.log(\nonBannerDidLoadAd\n) },\n    onBannerDidFailToLoadAd: function() { cc.log(\nonBannerDidFailToLoadAd\n) },\n    onBannerDidClick: function() { cc.log(\nonBannerDidClick\n) },\n    onBannerPresent: function() { cc.log(\nonBannerPresent\n) },\n    onInterstitialDidLoadAd: function() { cc.log(\nonInterstitialDidLoadAd\n) },\n    onInterstitialDidFailToLoadAd: function() { cc.log(\nonInterstitialDidFailToLoadAd\n) },\n    onInterstitialWillPresent: function() { cc.log(\nonInterstitialWillPresent\n) },\n    onInterstitialDidDismiss: function() { cc.log(\nonInterstitialDidDismiss\n) },\n    onInterstitialDidClick: function() { cc.log(\nonInterstitialDidClick\n) },\n    onVideoDidLoadAd: function() { cc.log(\nonVideoDidLoadAd\n) },\n    onVideoDidFailToLoadAd: function() { cc.log(\nonVideoDidFailToLoadAd\n) },\n    onVideoDidPresent: function() { cc.log(\nonVideoDidPresent\n) },\n    onVideoWillDismiss: function() { cc.log(\nonVideoWillDismiss\n) },\n    onVideoDidFinish: function() { cc.log(\nonVideoDidFinish\n) }\n})\nplugin.init()\n\n\n\n\nAPI Reference\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.init();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitialize the plugin instance.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.setListener(listener);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet listener to listen for Appodeal events\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.setDebugEnabled(debugEnabled);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.showAd(style);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.cacheAd(type);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.hideBanner();\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.isReadyForShowWithStyle(showStyle);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.setUserVkId(vkId);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.setUserFacebookId(facebookId);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.setUserEmail(email);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.setUserBirthday(birthday);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.setUserAge(age);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.setUserGender(gender);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.setUserOccupation(occupation);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.setUserRelationship(relationship);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.setUserSmokingAttitude(smokingAttitude);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.setUserAlcoholAttitude(alcoholAttitude);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginAppodeal.setUserInterests(interests);\n\n\n\n\nListeners\n\n\nonBannerDidLoadAd();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when banner ad load\n\n\n\n\nonBannerDidFailToLoadAd();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when banner ad fail to load\n\n\n\n\nonBannerDidClick();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when banner ad clicked\n\n\n\n\nonBannerPresent();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when banner ad present\n\n\n\n\nonInterstitialDidLoadAd();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when interstitial ad load\n\n\n\n\nonInterstitialDidFailToLoadAd();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when interstitial ad fail to load\n\n\n\n\nonInterstitialWillPresent();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when interstitial ad present\n\n\n\n\nonInterstitialDidDismiss();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when interstitial dismiss\n\n\n\n\nonInterstitialDidClick();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when interstitial ad clicked\n\n\n\n\nonVideoDidLoadAd();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when video load\n\n\n\n\nonVideoDidFailToLoadAd();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when video fail to load\n\n\n\n\nonVideoDidPresent();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when video present\n\n\n\n\nonVideoWillDismiss();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when video dismiss\n\n\n\n\nonVideoDidFinish();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when video finish\n\n\n\n\nManual Integration\n\n\nIf the \nSDKBOX Installer\n \nfails\n to complete successfully, it is possible to integrate SDKBOX manually.

If you do not, your app will fail Apple's submission process.\n\n\nWhitelist canOpenURL function\n\n\nThis depends on what plugins are in your project. You may need to add the required entry to the \ninfo.plist\n, under \nLSApplicationQueriesSchemes\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON Configuration\n\n\nSDKBOX Installer will automatically create a sample configuration \nsdkbox_config.json\n for you\n\n\nHere is an example of the Bee7 configuration you can enable/disable debug mode for Bee7 here\n\n\nBee7\n:\n{\n    \ndebug\n:true,\n    \nkey\n:\nFE74A9C4-1288-4F6F-8D6E-C365699F2C72\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nExtra steps\n\n\nThe following step assumes you already registered at \nBee7\n, created a new \nAPP\n and activated it.\n\n\nSetup iOS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \nInfo.plist\n, add URL Schemes:\n\n\nTarget -\n Info -\n URL Types\n:\n\n\n\n\nclick \"+\"\n\n\nfill \"URL Schemes\" with \"your bee7 scheme\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup Android\n\n\n\n\nOpen \nAndroidManifest.xml\n and replace \n_replace_with_your_bee7_scheme_\n with your \nbee7 scheme\n\n\nOpen \nproject.properties\n and change target to \ntarget=android-21\n\n\n\n\nRegister Javascript Functions\n\n\nYou need to register all the Bee7 JS functions with cocos2d-x before using them.\n\n\nTo do this:\n* Modify \n./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp\n to include the following headers:\n\n\n#include \nPluginBee7JS.hpp\n\n#include \nPluginBee7JSHelper.h\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \n./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp\n make sure to call:\n\n\n\n\nsc-\naddRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginBee7JS);\nsc-\naddRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginBee7JS_helper);\n\n\n\n\nInitialize Bee7\n\n\nInitialize the plugin by calling \ninit()\n where appropriate in your code. We\nrecommend to do this in the \napp.js\n. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginBee7.init();\n\n\n\n\nUsing Bee7\n\n\nShow Game Wall\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginBee7.showGameWall();\n\n\n\n\nBee7 events\n\n\nThis allows you to catch \nBee7\n events so that you can perform operations after Bee7 events have occurred.\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginBee7.setListener({\n    onAvailableChange: function(available) {},\n    onVisibleChange: function(available) {},\n    onGameWallWillClose: function() {},\n    onGiveReward: function(bee7Points, virtualCurrencyAmount, appId, cappedReward,\n                           campaignId, videoReward) {}\n});\n\n\n\n\nAPI Reference\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginBee7.init();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitialize the plugin instance.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginBee7.showGameWall();\n\n\n\n\nListeners\n\n\nonAvailableChange(available);\n\n\n\n\nonVisibleChange(available);\n\n\n\n\nonGameWallWillClose();\n\n\n\n\nonGiveReward(bee7Points,\n              virtualCurrencyAmount,\n              appId,\n              cappedReward,\n              campaignId,\n              videoReward);\n\n\n\n\nManual Integration\n\n\nIf the \nSDKBOX Installer\n \nfails\n to complete successfully, it is possible to integrate SDKBOX manually. If the installer complete successfully, please \ndo not\n complete anymore of this document. It is not necessary.\n\n\nThese steps are listed last in this document on purpose as they are seldom needed. If you find yourself using these steps, please, after completing, double back and re-read the steps above for other integration items.\n\n\nManual Integration For iOS\n\n\nDrag and drop the following frameworks from the \nplugins/ios\n folder of\nthe\nBee7\n bundle into your Xcode project, check \nCopy items if needed\n when adding frameworks:\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.framework\n\n\nPluginBee7.framework\n\n\nBee7GWResources.bundle\n\n\n\n\nThe above frameworks depend upon a large number of other frameworks. You also need to add the following system frameworks, if you don't already have them:\n\n\n\n\nMessageUI.framework\n\n\nCoreMedia.framework\n\n\nSystemConfiguration.framework\n\n\nStoreKit.framework\n\n\nAdSupport.framework\n\n\nlibsqlite3.dylib\n\n\n\n\nAdd separate linker flags

Integration For Android\n\n\nSDKBOX supports three different kinds of \nAndroid\n projects \ncommand-line\n, \neclipse\n and \nAndroid Studio\n. \n\n\n\n\nproj.android\n will be used as our \nproject_root\n for \ncommand-line\n and \neclipse\n project\n\n\nproj.android-studio\n will be used as our \nproject_root\n for \nAndroid Studio\n project.\n\n\n\n\nCopy Files\n\n\nCopy the

requirements to \nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES\n:\n\n\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += PluginBee7\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += sdkbox\n\n\n\n\nAdd a call to:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n\n\n\n\nbefore any \nimport-module\n statements.\n\n\nAdd additional \nimport-module\n statements at the end:\n\n\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginbee7)\n\n\n\n\nThis means that your ordering should look similar to this:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginbee7)\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n It is important to make sure these statements are above the existing \n$(call import-module,./prebuilt-mk)\n statement, if you are using the pre-built libraries.\n\n\nModify \nApplication.mk\n (Cocos2d-x v3.0 to v3.2 only)\n\n\nEdit \nproject_root\n/jni/Application.mk\n to make sure \nAPP_STL\n is defined\ncorrectly. If \nApplication.mk\n contains \nAPP_STL := c++_static\n, it should be\nchanged to:\n\n\nAPP_STL := gnustl_static\n\n\n\n\nAdd \nAPP_PATFORM\n version requirements:\n\n\nAPP_PLATFORM := android-21\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.property\n\n\nandroid.library.reference.1=./libs/bee7-android-sdk-gamewall\n\n\n\n\nCopy all source and header files from \nplugin/jsbindings/\n to your projects \nClasses\n folder.\n\n\nAdd all \n.cpp\n files, that you just copied, to \nAndroid.mk\n in the \nLOCAL_SRC_FILES\n section. Example\n\n\nLOCAL_SRC_FILES := hellocpp/main.cpp \\\n                  ../../Classes/AppDelegate.cpp \\\n                  ../../Classes/HelloWorldScene.cpp \\\n                                    ../../Classes/NewSourceFile.cpp\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using cocos2d-x from source, assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/\nlib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using the prebuilt cocos2d-x libraries assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n./src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n When using Cocos2d-x from source, different versions have \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n in a different location. One way to find the location is to look in \nproj.android/project.properties\n. Example:\n  \nandroid.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java\n\n\nIn this case, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n should be located at:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to add the following imports:\n\n\n\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, modify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to edit the \nonCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)\n function to add a call to \nSDKBox.init(this);\n. The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to \nonLoadNativeLibraries();\n. Example:\n\n\n\n\nonLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code. There are a few rules here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has not been defined, \nadd it\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has been defined, add the calls to \nSDKBox\n in the \nsame\n existing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nProguard (optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file. Example:\n\n\n\n\nproguard.config=${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt:proguard-project.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the file you specified to include the following:\n\n\n\n\n# bee7\n-keep public class com.bee7.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.bee7.**\n\n# cocos2d-x\n-keep public class org.cocos2dx.** { *; }\n-dontwarn org.cocos2dx.**\n-keep public class com.chukong.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.chukong.**\n\n# google play service\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.** { public *; }\n-dontwarn com.google.android.gms.**\n\n-keep class * extends java.util.ListResourceBundle {\n    protected Object[][] getContents();\n}\n\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.common.internal.safeparcel.SafeParcelable {\n    public static final *** NULL;\n}\n\n-keepnames @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName class *\n-keepclassmembernames class * {\n    @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName *;\n}\n\n-keepnames class * implements android.os.Parcelable {\n    public static final ** CREATOR;\n}\n\n#sdkbox\n-keep class com.sdkbox.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.sdkbox.**\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Proguard only works with \nRelease\n builds (i.e \ncocos run -m release\n) debug builds do not invoke Proguard rules.",

Edit  AndroidManifest.xml  Include the following permissions above the  application tag :  uses-permission android:name= android.permission.INTERNET  /  uses-permission android:name= android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE  /   Make sure that you have one of the two settings below, for proper function of the game wall\u2019s video component:    uses-sdk  with targetSdkVersion set to the latest Android SDK version available, for example:  xml uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion=\"9\" android:targetSdkVersion=\"23\" .../    The flag  android:hardwareAccelerated  set to  true  for your application (or for the activity that\n    will display the game wall \u2013 that is a custom main activity):  xml\n     application android:label=\"@string/app_name\"\n             android:icon=\"@drawable/icon\"\n             android:hardwareAccelerated=\"true\" \n     /application    There are also a few necessary meta-data tags that also need to be added:  activity \n   intent-filter \n       action android:name= android.intent.action.VIEW / \n       category android:name= android.intent.category.DEFAULT / \n       category android:name= android.intent.category.BROWSABLE / \n       data android:scheme= your_bee7_scheme  android:host= publisher / \n   /intent-filter  /activity  service\n  android:name= com.bee7.sdk.service.RewardingService \n  android:process= :rewardingservice \n  android:enabled= true  /service  receiver android:name= com.bee7.sdk.publisher.RewardReceiver  android:enabled= true  android:exported= true \n     intent-filter \n         action android:name= com.bee7.action.REWARD  / \n     /intent-filter  /receiver  receiver\n  android:name= com.bee7.sdk.service.RewardingServiceReceiver \n  android:enabled= true \n  android:exported= true \n     intent-filter \n         action android:name= android.intent.action.USER_PRESENT  / \n     /intent-filter  /receiver   Edit  Android.mk  Edit  project_root /jni/Android.mk  to:  Add additional requirements to  LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES :  LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += PluginBee7\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += sdkbox  Add a call to:  $(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))  before any  import-module  statements.  Add additional  import-module  statements at the end:  $(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginbee7)  This means that your ordering should look similar to this:  $(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginbee7)  Note:  It is important to make sure these statements are above the existing  $(call import-module,./prebuilt-mk)  statement, if you are using the pre-built libraries.  Modify  Application.mk  (Cocos2d-x v3.0 to v3.2 only)  Edit  project_root /jni/Application.mk  to make sure  APP_STL  is defined\ncorrectly. If  Application.mk  contains  APP_STL := c++_static , it should be\nchanged to:  APP_STL := gnustl_static  Add  APP_PATFORM  version requirements:  APP_PLATFORM := android-21  Edit  project.property  android.library.reference.1=./libs/bee7-android-sdk-gamewall  Copy all source and header files from  plugin/jsbindings/  to your projects  Classes  folder.  Add all  .cpp  files, that you just copied, to  Android.mk  in the  LOCAL_SRC_FILES  section. Example  LOCAL_SRC_FILES := hellocpp/main.cpp \\\n                  ../../Classes/AppDelegate.cpp \\\n                  ../../Classes/HelloWorldScene.cpp \\\n                                    ../../Classes/NewSourceFile.cpp  Modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java    If you're using cocos2d-x from source, assuming you are in the  proj.android  directory,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  is located:  ../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/\nlib/Cocos2dxActivity.java    If you're using the prebuilt cocos2d-x libraries assuming you are in the  proj.android  directory,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  is located:  ./src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java    Note:  When using Cocos2d-x from source, different versions have  Cocos2dxActivity.java  in a different location. One way to find the location is to look in  proj.android/project.properties . Example:\n   android.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java  In this case,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  should be located at:  ../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java   Modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to add the following imports:   import android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;   Second, modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to edit the  onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)  function to add a call to  SDKBox.init(this); . The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to  onLoadNativeLibraries(); . Example:   onLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);    Last, we need to insert the proper  overrides  code. There are a few rules here.    If the method listed has not been defined,  add it .

If you don't cocos2d-x will fail to build.\n\n\nSet your game requires full screen\n\n\nIf your game doesn't support all screen orientations you will need to check \nRequires full screen\n in Xcode. If you do not, your app will fail Apple's submission process.\n\n\nWhitelist canOpenURL function\n\n\nThis depends on what plugins are in your project. You may need to add the required entry to the \ninfo.plist\n, under \nLSApplicationQueriesSchemes\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON Configuration\n\n\nSDKBOX Installer will automatically create a sample configuration \nsdkbox_config.json\n for you\n\n\nHere is an example of the Bee7 configuration you can enable/disable debug mode for Bee7 here\n\n\nBee7\n:\n{\n    \ndebug\n:true,\n    \nkey\n:\nFE74A9C4-1288-4F6F-8D6E-C365699F2C72\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nExtra steps\n\n\nThe following step assumes you already registered at \nBee7\n, created a new \nAPP\n and activated it.\n\n\nSetup iOS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \nInfo.plist\n, add URL Schemes:\n\n\nTarget -\n Info -\n URL Types\n:\n\n\n\n\nclick \"+\"\n\n\nfill \"URL Schemes\" with \"your bee7 scheme\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup Android\n\n\n\n\nOpen \nAndroidManifest.xml\n and replace \n_replace_with_your_bee7_scheme_\n with your \nbee7 scheme\n\n\nOpen \nproject.properties\n and change target to \ntarget=android-21\n\n\n\n\nRegister Javascript Functions\n\n\nYou need to register all the Bee7 JS functions with cocos2d-x before using them.\n\n\nTo do this:\n* Modify \n./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp\n to include the following headers:\n\n\n#include \nPluginBee7JS.hpp\n\n#include \nPluginBee7JSHelper.h\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \n./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp\n make sure to call:\n\n\n\n\nsc-\naddRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginBee7JS);\nsc-\naddRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginBee7JS_helper);\n\n\n\n\nInitialize Bee7\n\n\nInitialize the plugin by calling \ninit()\n where appropriate in your code. We\nrecommend to do this in the \napp.js\n. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginBee7.init();\n\n\n\n\nUsing Bee7\n\n\nShow Game Wall\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginBee7.showGameWall();\n\n\n\n\nBee7 events\n\n\nThis allows you to catch \nBee7\n events so that you can perform operations after Bee7 events have occurred.\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginBee7.setListener({\n    onAvailableChange: function(available) {},\n    onVisibleChange: function(available) {},\n    onGameWallWillClose: function() {},\n    onGiveReward: function(bee7Points, virtualCurrencyAmount, appId, cappedReward,\n                           campaignId, videoReward) {}\n});\n\n\n\n\nAPI Reference\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginBee7.init();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitialize the plugin instance.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginBee7.showGameWall();\n\n\n\n\nListeners\n\n\nonAvailableChange(available);\n\n\n\n\nonVisibleChange(available);\n\n\n\n\nonGameWallWillClose();\n\n\n\n\nonGiveReward(bee7Points,\n              virtualCurrencyAmount,\n              appId,\n              cappedReward,\n              campaignId,\n              videoReward);\n\n\n\n\nManual Integration\n\n\nIf the \nSDKBOX Installer\n \nfails\n to complete successfully, it is possible to integrate SDKBOX manually. If the installer complete successfully, please \ndo not\n complete anymore of this document. It is not necessary.\n\n\nThese steps are listed last in this document on purpose as they are seldom needed. If you find yourself using these steps, please, after completing, double back and re-read the steps above for other integration items.\n\n\nManual Integration For iOS\n\n\nDrag and drop the following frameworks from the \nplugins/ios\n folder of\nthe\nBee7\n bundle into your Xcode project, check \nCopy items if needed\n when adding frameworks:\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.framework\n\n\nPluginBee7.framework\n\n\nBee7GWResources.bundle\n\n\n\n\nThe above frameworks depend upon a large number of other frameworks. You also need to add the following system frameworks, if you don't already have them:\n\n\n\n\nMessageUI.framework\n\n\nCoreMedia.framework\n\n\nSystemConfiguration.framework\n\n\nStoreKit.framework\n\n\nAdSupport.framework\n\n\nlibsqlite3.dylib\n\n\n\n\nAdd separate linker flags

your projects \nClasses\n folder.\n\n\nAdd these same files, that you just copied, to Xcode by either dragging and dropping them into Xcode or by using \nFile -\n Add files to...\n.\n\n\nManual Integration For Android\n\n\nSDKBOX supports three different kinds of \nAndroid\n projects \ncommand-line\n, \neclipse\n and \nAndroid Studio\n. \n\n\n\n\nproj.android\n will be used as our \nproject_root\n for \ncommand-line\n and \neclipse\n project\n\n\nproj.android-studio\n will be used as our \nproject_root\n for \nAndroid Studio\n project.\n\n\n\n\nCopy Files\n\n\nCopy the

from \nplugin/android/libs\n to your \nproj.android/libs/\n directory.\n\n\nEdit \nAndroidManifest.xml\n\n\nInclude the following permissions above the \napplication tag\n:\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.INTERNET\n /\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\n /\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that you have one of the two settings below, for proper function of the game wall\u2019s video component:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuses-sdk\n with targetSdkVersion set to the latest Android SDK version available, for example:\n\n\nxml\n\nuses-sdk

PluginBee7\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += sdkbox\n\n\n\n\nAdd a call to:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n\n\n\n\nbefore any \nimport-module\n statements.\n\n\nAdd additional \nimport-module\n statements at the end:\n\n\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginbee7)\n\n\n\n\nThis means that your ordering should look similar to this:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginbee7)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nAplication.mk\n\n\nEdit \nproj.android/jni/Application.mk\n to:\n\n\nAdd \nAPP_PATFORM\n version requirements:\n\n\nAPP_PLATFORM := android-21\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.property\n\n\nandroid.library.reference.1=./libs/bee7-android-sdk-gamewall\n\n\n\n\nCopy all source and header files from \nplugin/jsbindings/\n to your projects \nClasses\n folder.\n\n\nAdd all \n.cpp\n files, that you just copied, to \nAndroid.mk\n in the \nLOCAL_SRC_FILES\n section. Example\n\n\nLOCAL_SRC_FILES := hellocpp/main.cpp \\\n                  ../../Classes/AppDelegate.cpp \\\n                  ../../Classes/HelloWorldScene.cpp \\\n                                    ../../Classes/NewSourceFile.cpp\n\n\n\n\nModify \n.java\n\n\n\n\nModify \nproj.android/src/\n/\n.java\n to add the following imports:\n\n\n\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, modify the class to edit the \nonCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)\n function to add a call to \nSDKBox.init(this);\n. Example of what this might look like for you:\n\n\n\n\nprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState){\n  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n  SDKBox.init(this);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code. There are a few rules here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has not been defined, \nadd it\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has been defined, add the calls to \nSDKBox\n in the \nsame\n existing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nProguard (optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file. Example:\n\n\n\n\nproguard.config=${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt:proguard-project.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the file you specified to include the following:\n\n\n\n\n# bee7\n-keep public class com.bee7.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.bee7.**\n\n# cocos2d-x\n-keep public class org.cocos2dx.** { *; }\n-dontwarn org.cocos2dx.**\n-keep public class com.chukong.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.chukong.**\n\n# google play service\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.** { public *; }\n-dontwarn com.google.android.gms.**\n\n-keep class * extends java.util.ListResourceBundle {\n    protected Object[][] getContents();\n}\n\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.common.internal.safeparcel.SafeParcelable {\n    public static final *** NULL;\n}\n\n-keepnames @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName class *\n-keepclassmembernames class * {\n    @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName *;\n}\n\n-keepnames class * implements android.os.Parcelable {\n    public static final ** CREATOR;\n}\n\n#sdkbox\n-keep class com.sdkbox.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.sdkbox.**\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Proguard only works with \nRelease\n builds (i.e \ncocos run -m release\n) debug builds do not invoke Proguard rules.",

If \nApplication.mk\n contains \nAPP_STL := c++_static\n, it should be\nchanged to:\n\n\nAPP_STL := gnustl_static\n\n\n\n\nCopy all source and header files from \nplugin/jsbindings/\n to your projects \nClasses\n folder.\n\n\nAdd all \n.cpp\n files, that you just copied, to \nAndroid.mk\n in the \nLOCAL_SRC_FILES\n section. Example\n\n\nLOCAL_SRC_FILES := hellocpp/main.cpp \\\n                  ../../Classes/AppDelegate.cpp \\\n                  ../../Classes/HelloWorldScene.cpp \\\n                                    ../../Classes/NewSourceFile.cpp\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using cocos2d-x from source, assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/\nlib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using the prebuilt cocos2d-x libraries assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n./src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n When using Cocos2d-x from source, different versions have \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n in a different location. One way to find the location is to look in \nproj.android/project.properties\n. Example:\n  \nandroid.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java\n\n\nIn this case, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n should be located at:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to add the following imports:\n\n\n\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, modify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to edit the \nonCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)\n function to add a call to \nSDKBox.init(this);\n. The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to \nonLoadNativeLibraries();\n. Example:\n\n\n\n\nonLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code. There are a few rules here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has not been defined, \nadd it\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has been defined, add the calls to \nSDKBox\n in the \nsame\n existing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nProguard (optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file. Example:\n\n\n\n\nproguard.config=${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt:proguard-project.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the file you specified to include the following:\n\n\n\n\n# chartboost\n-keep class com.chartboost.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.chartboost.**\n\n\n# cocos2d-x\n-keep public class org.cocos2dx.** { *; }\n-dontwarn org.cocos2dx.**\n-keep public class com.chukong.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.chukong.**\n\n# google play service\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.** { public *; }\n-dontwarn com.google.android.gms.**\n\n-keep class * extends java.util.ListResourceBundle {\n    protected Object[][] getContents();\n}\n\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.common.internal.safeparcel.SafeParcelable {\n    public static final *** NULL;\n}\n\n-keepnames @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName class *\n-keepclassmembernames class * {\n    @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName *;\n}\n\n-keepnames class * implements android.os.Parcelable {\n    public static final ** CREATOR;\n}\n\n#sdkbox\n-keep class com.sdkbox.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.sdkbox.**\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Proguard only works with \nRelease\n builds (i.e \ncocos run -m release\n) debug builds do not invoke Proguard rules.",

Modify  Application.mk  (Cocos2d-x v3.0 to v3.2 only)  Edit  project_root /jni/Application.mk  to make sure  APP_STL  is defined\ncorrectly.

One way to find the location is to look in  proj.android/project.properties . Example:\n   android.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java  In this case,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  should be located at:  ../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java   Modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to add the following imports:   import android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;   Second, modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to edit the  onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)  function to add a call to  SDKBox.init(this); .

The API call is \ninviteFriends()\n passing in an \napp link url\n and a \npreview image\n. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox::PluginFacebook::inviteFriends(\n  \nhttps://fb.me/322164761287181\n,\n  \nhttp://www.cocos2d-x.org/attachments/801/cocos2dx_portrait.png\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Contrary to what it may seem the \napp link url\n, it is not an App Store or Google Play application url. You must follow the instructions on this \npage\n  and use the resulting url as the \napp_link_url\n parameter. Facebook hosts this file for the developer, but anyone could host their own file using this \nformat\n\n\n\n\nAt runtime, a custom message can be attached to the invite request. It is not possible to set a predefined invite message.\n\n\nCreating a \ncustom invite dialog\n is a two step process, starting with a call to \nrequestInvitableFriends()\n then a call to \ninviteFriendsWithInviteIds()\n to actually send the invites. Example:\n\n\nstd::vector\nstd::string\n vec;\nvec.push_back(invitable_token);\nsdkbox::PluginFacebook::inviteFriendsWithInviteIds(vec, \nInvitation title\n, \nInvitation text up to 60 chars.\n);\n\n\n\n\nThe \nrequestInvitableFriends()\n function has a \nBundle(map\n)\n parameter, where the developer can define a few flags:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlag\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfields\n\n\na comma separated values of the fields you want to get from your invitable friend\u2019s profiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexclude_ids\n\n\na comma separated FB ids to exclude from the result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlimit\n\n\nnumber of friends per page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA call to \nrequestInvitableFriends()\n will return a different collection of friends per call, and it is Facebook's decision which ones to return first.\nThis function returns a \nFBInvitableFriendsInfo\n object, which will contain a collection of the friends data and a pagination cursor object which has URLS for requesting the next and previous page of invitable friends.\n\n\nThe \ncustom invite dialog\n is only available for games with a \ncanvas implementation\n for the Facebook application. The \ncanvas\n must be defined but doesn't need to how any web content. If the \ncanvas\n is not defined a \nstandard invite dialog\n is used instead.\n\n\nGraph API\n\n\nYou can perform \nGraph API\n using the \napi\n function\n\n\nFor example, to get the friend list:\n\n\nsdkbox::PluginFacebook::FBAPIParam params;\nsdkbox::PluginFacebook::api(\n/me/friendlists\n, \nGET\n, params, \n/me/friendlists\n);\n\n\n\n\nFacebook events\n\n\nThis allows you to catch \nFacebook\n events so that you can perform operations after Facebook events have occurred.\n\n\n\n\nAllow your class to extend \nsdkbox::FacebookListener\n and override the functions listed:\n\n\n\n\n#include \nPluginFacebook/PluginFacebook.h\n\nclass MyClass : public sdkbox::FacebookListener\n{\nprivate:\n  void onLogin(bool isLogin, const std::string\n msg);\n  void onPermission(bool isLogin, const std::string\n msg);\n  void onAPI(const std::string\n tag, const std::string\n jsonData);\n  void onSharedSuccess(const std::string\n message);\n  void onSharedFailed(const std::string\n message);\n  void onSharedCancel();\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a \nlistener\n that handles callbacks:\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox::PluginFacebook::setListener(this);\n\n\n\n\nAPI

Invite  There are both  standard  and  custom   Invite  dialogs available to use when inviting your Friends.  When using the  standard invite dialog , it is necessary to select the friends to send the invitation request too. The API call is  inviteFriends()  passing in an  app link url  and a  preview image . Example:  sdkbox::PluginFacebook::inviteFriends(\n   https://fb.me/322164761287181 ,\n   http://www.cocos2d-x.org/attachments/801/cocos2dx_portrait.png );   Note: Contrary to what it may seem the  app link url , it is not an App Store or Google Play application url. You must follow the instructions on this  page   and use the resulting url as the  app_link_url  parameter. Facebook hosts this file for the developer, but anyone could host their own file using this  format   At runtime, a custom message can be attached to the invite request. It is not possible to set a predefined invite message.  Creating a  custom invite dialog  is a two step process, starting with a call to  requestInvitableFriends()  then a call to  inviteFriendsWithInviteIds()  to actually send the invites. Example:  std::vector std::string  vec;\nvec.push_back(invitable_token);\nsdkbox::PluginFacebook::inviteFriendsWithInviteIds(vec,  Invitation title ,  Invitation text up to 60 chars. );  The  requestInvitableFriends()  function has a  Bundle(map )  parameter, where the developer can define a few flags:     Flag  Description      fields  a comma separated values of the fields you want to get from your invitable friend\u2019s profiles.    exclude_ids  a comma separated FB ids to exclude from the result.    limit  number of friends per page.     A call to  requestInvitableFriends()  will return a different collection of friends per call, and it is Facebook's decision which ones to return first.\nThis function returns a  FBInvitableFriendsInfo  object, which will contain a collection of the friends data and a pagination cursor object which has URLS for requesting the next and previous page of invitable friends.  The  custom invite dialog  is only available for games with a  canvas implementation  for the Facebook application. The  canvas  must be defined but doesn't need to how any web content. If the  canvas  is not defined a  standard invite dialog  is used instead.  Graph API  You can perform  Graph API  using the  api  function  For example, to get the friend list:  sdkbox::PluginFacebook::FBAPIParam params;\nsdkbox::PluginFacebook::api( /me/friendlists ,  GET , params,  /me/friendlists );  Facebook events  This allows you to catch  Facebook  events so that you can perform operations after Facebook events have occurred.   Allow your class to extend  sdkbox::FacebookListener  and override the functions listed:   #include  PluginFacebook/PluginFacebook.h \nclass MyClass : public sdkbox::FacebookListener\n{\nprivate:\n  void onLogin(bool isLogin, const std::string  msg);\n  void onPermission(bool isLogin, const std::string  msg);\n  void onAPI(const std::string  tag, const std::string  jsonData);\n  void onSharedSuccess(const std::string  message);\n  void onSharedFailed(const std::string  message);\n  void onSharedCancel();\n};   Create a  listener  that handles callbacks:   sdkbox::PluginFacebook::setListener(this);",

Add additional  import-module  statements at the end:  $(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginfacebook)  This means that your ordering should look similar to this:  $(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginfacebook)  Note:  It is important to make sure these statements are above the existing  $(call import-module,./prebuilt-mk)  statement, if you are using the pre-built libraries.  Modify  Application.mk  (Cocos2d-x v3.0 to v3.2 only)  Edit  project_root /jni/Application.mk  to make sure  APP_STL  is defined\ncorrectly. If  Application.mk  contains  APP_STL := c++_static , it should be\nchanged to:  APP_STL := gnustl_static  Modify  project.properties  Add following line to your  project.properties  android.library.reference.1=./libs/facebook_lib   Note: if you already have an  android.library.reference.1  you can add\nanother by incrementing the final digit as  android.library.reference.2 , etc.   Modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java    If you're using cocos2d-x from source, assuming you are in the  proj.android  directory,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  is located:  ../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/\nlib/Cocos2dxActivity.java    If you're using the prebuilt cocos2d-x libraries assuming you are in the  proj.android  directory,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  is located:  ./src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java    Note:  When using Cocos2d-x from source, different versions have  Cocos2dxActivity.java  in a different location. One way to find the location is to look in  proj.android/project.properties . Example:\n   android.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java  In this case,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  should be located at:  ../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java   Modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to add the following imports:   import android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;   Second, modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to edit the  onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)  function to add a call to  SDKBox.init(this); . The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to  onLoadNativeLibraries(); . Example:   onLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);    Last, we need to insert the proper  overrides  code. There are a few rules here.    If the method listed has not been defined,  add it .

We\nrecommend to do this in the \napp.js\n. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.init();\n\n\n\n\nUsing Facebook\n\n\nLogin\n\n\nFirst the user needs to login to Facebook in order to use it.\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.login();\n\n\n\n\nIf a user doesn't want to use Facebook functionality anymore, logout. using\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.logout();\n\n\n\n\nYou can check whether user already logged in using\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.isLoggedIn();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: user only needs to perform login once, unless they logout\n\n\n\n\nPermissions\n\n\nFacebook requires you to ask for the user's permission before you can perform actions, such as, posting on the user's behalf.\nThere are two types of permission \nread\n and \npublish\n\nYou can get a complete list of permissions \nhere\n\n\nTo request a permission, you do so by specifying what you want:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.requestReadPermissions([\npublic_profile\n, \nemail\n]);\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.requestPublishPermissions([\npublish_actions\n]);\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\nThere are two types of sharing functionality.\n\n\n\n\nshare\n will automatically post to the users wall\nshare a link:\n\n\n\n\nvar info = new Object();\ninfo.type  = \nlink\n;\ninfo.link  = \nhttp://www.cocos2d-x.org\n;\ninfo.title = \ncocos2d-x\n;\ninfo.text  = \nBest Game Engine\n;\ninfo.image = \nhttp://cocos2d-x.org/images/logo.png\n;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.share(info);\n\n\n\n\nshare a photo:\n\n\nvar info = new Object();\ninfo.type  = \nphoto\n;\ninfo.title = \nMy Photo\n;\ninfo.image = __path to image__;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.share(info);\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndialog\n will show a dialog and prompt the user to write their own comments in addition:\n\n\n\n\npresent a share dialog:\n\n\nvar info = new Object();\ninfo.type  = \nlink\n;\ninfo.link  = \nhttp://www.cocos2d-x.org\n;\ninfo.title = \ncocos2d-x\n;\ninfo.text  = \nBest Game Engine\n;\ninfo.image = \nhttp://cocos2d-x.org/images/logo.png\n;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.dialog(info);\n\n\n\n\nshare a photo with comments:\n\n\nvar info = new Object();\ninfo.type  = \nphoto\n;\ninfo.title = \nMy Photo\n;\ninfo.image = __path to image__;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.dialog(info);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: sharing photo with comments requires the \nFacebook app\n to be installed on the device.\n\n\n\n\nInvite\n\n\nThere are both \nstandard\n and \ncustom\n \nInvite\n dialogs available to use when inviting your Friends.\n\n\nWhen using the \nstandard invite dialog\n, it is necessary to select the friends to send the invitation request too. The API call is \ninviteFriends()\n passing in a URL for \napp\n and a \npreview image\n. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.inviteFriends(\n \nhttps://fb.me/322164761287181\n,\n \nhttp://www.cocos2d-x.org/attachments/801/cocos2dx_portrait.png\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Contrary to what it may seem the \napp link url\n, it is not an App Store or Google Play application url. You must follow the instructions on this \npage\n  and use the resulting url as the \napp_link_url\n parameter. Facebook hosts this file for the developer, but anyone could host their own file using this \nformat\n\n\n\n\nCreating a \ncustom invite dialog\n is a two step process, starting with a call to \nrequestInvitableFriends()\n then a call to \ninviteFriendsWithInviteIds()\n to actually send the invites. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.inviteFriendsWithInviteIds([], \u201ctitle\n, \u201cinvitation text\n);\n\n\n\n\nThe \nrequestInvitableFriends()\n function has a \nBundle(map\n)\n parameter, where the developer can define a few flags:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlag\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfields\n\n\na comma separated values of the fields you want to get from your invitable friend\u2019s profiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexclude_ids\n\n\na comma separated FB ids to exclude from the result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlimit\n\n\nnumber of friends per page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA call to \nrequestInvitableFriends()\n will return a different collection of friends per call, and it is Facebook's decision which ones to return first.\nThis function returns a \nFBInvitableFriendsInfo\n object, which will contain a collection of the friends data and a pagination cursor object which has URLS for requesting the next and previous page of invitable friends.\n\n\nThe \ncustom invite dialog\n is only available for games with a \ncanvas implementation\n for the Facebook application. The \ncanvas\n must be defined but doesn't need to how any web content. If the \ncanvas\n is not defined a \nstandard invite dialog\n is used instead.\n\n\nGraph API\n\n\nYou can perform \nGraph API\n using the \napi\n function\n\n\nFor example, to get the friend list:\n\n\nvar params = new Object();\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.api(\n/me/friendlists\n, \nGET\n, params, \n/me/friendlists\n);\n\n\n\n\nFacebook events\n\n\nThis allows you to catch \nFacebook\n events so that you can perform operations after Facebook events have occurred.\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.setListener({\n    onLogin: function(isLogin, msg) {},\n    onAPI: function(tag, data) {},\n    onSharedSuccess: function(data) {},\n    onSharedFailed: function(data) {},\n    onSharedCancel: function() {},\n    onPermission: function(isLogin, msg) {}\n});\n\n\n\n\nAPI Reference\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.init();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitialize the plugin instance.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.login();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog in\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.requestReadPermissions(permissions);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog in with specific read permissions, conflict with publish permissions\nhttps://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.requestPublishPermissions(permissions);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog in with specific public permissions\nhttps://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.logout();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog out\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.isLoggedIn();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck whether the user logined or not\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.getUserID();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nget UserID\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.getAccessToken();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nget AccessToken\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.getPermissionList();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nget permissoin list\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.share(info);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshare\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.dialog(info);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nopen a dialog of Facebook app or WebDialog (dialog with photo only avaible with native Facebook app)\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.getSDKVersion();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreturn the version of Facebook SDK\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.fetchFriends();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfetch friends data from Facebook\n\n\n\n\nListeners\n\n\nonLogin(isLogin, msg);\n\n\n\n\nonSharedSuccess(message);\n\n\n\n\nonSharedFailed(message);\n\n\n\n\nonSharedCancel();\n\n\n\n\nonAPI(key, jsonData);\n\n\n\n\nonPermission(isLogin, msg);\n\n\n\n\nonFetchFriends(ok, msg);\n\n\n\n\nManual Integration\n\n\nIf the \nSDKBOX Installer\n \nfails\n to complete successfully, it is possible to integrate SDKBOX manually. If the installer complete successfully, please \ndo not\n complete anymore of this document. It is not necessary.\n\n\nThese steps are listed last in this document on purpose as they are seldom needed.

One way to find the location is to look in \nproj.android/project.properties\n. Example:\n  \nandroid.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java\n\n\nIn this case, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n should be located at:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to add the following imports:\n\n\n\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, modify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to edit the \nonCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)\n function to add a call to \nSDKBox.init(this);\n. The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to \nonLoadNativeLibraries();\n. Example:\n\n\n\n\nonLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code. There are a few rules here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has not been defined, \nadd it\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has been defined, add the calls to \nSDKBox\n in the \nsame\n existing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nProguard (optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file. Example:\n\n\n\n\nproguard.config=${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt:proguard-project.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the file you specified to include the following:\n\n\n\n\n# facebook\n-keep public class com.facebook.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.facebook.**\n\n# cocos2d-x\n-keep public class org.cocos2dx.** { *; }\n-dontwarn org.cocos2dx.**\n-keep public class com.chukong.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.chukong.**\n\n# google play service\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.** { public *; }\n-dontwarn com.google.android.gms.**\n\n-keep class * extends java.util.ListResourceBundle {\n    protected Object[][] getContents();\n}\n\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.common.internal.safeparcel.SafeParcelable {\n    public static final *** NULL;\n}\n\n-keepnames @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName class *\n-keepclassmembernames class * {\n    @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName *;\n}\n\n-keepnames class * implements android.os.Parcelable {\n    public static final ** CREATOR;\n}\n\n#sdkbox\n-keep class com.sdkbox.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.sdkbox.**\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Proguard only works with \nRelease\n builds (i.e \ncocos run -m release\n) debug builds do not invoke Proguard rules.",

            "text": "Register Javascript Functions  You need to register all the Facebook JS functions with cocos2d-x before using them.  To do this:\n* Modify  ./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp  to include the following headers:  #include  PluginFacebookJS.hpp \n#include  PluginFacebookJSHelper.h    Modify  ./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp  make sure to call:   sc- addRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginFacebookJS);\nsc- addRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginFacebookJS_helper);  Initialize Facebook  Initialize the plugin by calling  init()  where appropriate in your code. We\nrecommend to do this in the  app.js . Example:  sdkbox.PluginFacebook.init();  Using Facebook  Login  First the user needs to login to Facebook in order to use it.  sdkbox.PluginFacebook.login();  If a user doesn't want to use Facebook functionality anymore, logout. using  sdkbox.PluginFacebook.logout();  You can check whether user already logged in using  sdkbox.PluginFacebook.isLoggedIn();   Note: user only needs to perform login once, unless they logout   Permissions  Facebook requires you to ask for the user's permission before you can perform actions, such as, posting on the user's behalf.\nThere are two types of permission  read  and  publish \nYou can get a complete list of permissions  here  To request a permission, you do so by specifying what you want:  sdkbox.PluginFacebook.requestReadPermissions([ public_profile ,  email ]);\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.requestPublishPermissions([ publish_actions ]);  Share  There are two types of sharing functionality.   share  will automatically post to the users wall\nshare a link:   var info = new Object();\ninfo.type  =  link ;\ninfo.link  =  http://www.cocos2d-x.org ;\ninfo.title =  cocos2d-x ;\ninfo.text  =  Best Game Engine ;\ninfo.image =  http://cocos2d-x.org/images/logo.png ;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.share(info);  share a photo:  var info = new Object();\ninfo.type  =  photo ;\ninfo.title =  My Photo ;\ninfo.image = __path to image__;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.share(info);   dialog  will show a dialog and prompt the user to write their own comments in addition:   present a share dialog:  var info = new Object();\ninfo.type  =  link ;\ninfo.link  =  http://www.cocos2d-x.org ;\ninfo.title =  cocos2d-x ;\ninfo.text  =  Best Game Engine ;\ninfo.image =  http://cocos2d-x.org/images/logo.png ;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.dialog(info);  share a photo with comments:  var info = new Object();\ninfo.type  =  photo ;\ninfo.title =  My Photo ;\ninfo.image = __path to image__;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.dialog(info);   Note: sharing photo with comments requires the  Facebook app  to be installed on the device.   Invite  There are both  standard  and  custom   Invite  dialogs available to use when inviting your Friends.  When using the  standard invite dialog , it is necessary to select the friends to send the invitation request too. The API call is  inviteFriends()  passing in a URL for  app  and a  preview image . Example:  sdkbox.PluginFacebook.inviteFriends(\n  https://fb.me/322164761287181 ,\n  http://www.cocos2d-x.org/attachments/801/cocos2dx_portrait.png );   Note: Contrary to what it may seem the  app link url , it is not an App Store or Google Play application url. You must follow the instructions on this  page   and use the resulting url as the  app_link_url  parameter. Facebook hosts this file for the developer, but anyone could host their own file using this  format   Creating a  custom invite dialog  is a two step process, starting with a call to  requestInvitableFriends()  then a call to  inviteFriendsWithInviteIds()  to actually send the invites. Example:  sdkbox.PluginFacebook.inviteFriendsWithInviteIds([], \u201ctitle , \u201cinvitation text );  The  requestInvitableFriends()  function has a  Bundle(map )  parameter, where the developer can define a few flags:     Flag  Description      fields  a comma separated values of the fields you want to get from your invitable friend\u2019s profiles.    exclude_ids  a comma separated FB ids to exclude from the result.    limit  number of friends per page.     A call to  requestInvitableFriends()  will return a different collection of friends per call, and it is Facebook's decision which ones to return first.\nThis function returns a  FBInvitableFriendsInfo  object, which will contain a collection of the friends data and a pagination cursor object which has URLS for requesting the next and previous page of invitable friends.  The  custom invite dialog  is only available for games with a  canvas implementation  for the Facebook application. The  canvas  must be defined but doesn't need to how any web content. If the  canvas  is not defined a  standard invite dialog  is used instead.  Graph API  You can perform  Graph API  using the  api  function  For example, to get the friend list:  var params = new Object();\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.api( /me/friendlists ,  GET , params,  /me/friendlists );  Facebook events  This allows you to catch  Facebook  events so that you can perform operations after Facebook events have occurred.  sdkbox.PluginFacebook.setListener({\n    onLogin: function(isLogin, msg) {},\n    onAPI: function(tag, data) {},\n    onSharedSuccess: function(data) {},\n    onSharedFailed: function(data) {},\n    onSharedCancel: function() {},\n    onPermission: function(isLogin, msg) {}\n});",

Note: sdkbox link with  gnustl  by default, if your project link with  c++static  please replace the files in  project_root /jni/ plugin_name /libs  with files in  project_root /jni/ plugin_name /libs_c++_static  folder   Edit  AndroidManifest.xml  Include the following permissions above the  application tag :     uses-permission android:name= android.permission.INTERNET  /   There are also a few necessary meta-data tags that also need to be added:  meta-data android:name= com.facebook.sdk.ApplicationId  android:value= @string/facebook_app_id /  activity android:name= com.facebook.FacebookActivity \n  android:configChanges=\n          keyboard|keyboardHidden|screenLayout|screenSize|orientation \n  android:theme= @android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar \n  android:label= @string/app_name  / \n\n   provider android:authorities= com.facebook.app.FacebookContentProvider__replace_with_your_app_id__ \n  android:name= com.facebook.FacebookContentProvider \n  android:exported= true  /   Edit strings.xml  Open  res/values/strings.xml , Add a new string with the name facebook_app_id  and value as your Facebook App ID. Example:     ?xml version= 1.0  encoding= utf-8 ? \n   resources \n       string name= app_name facebook /string \n       string name= facebook_app_id 280194012150923 /string \n   /resources   Edit  Android.mk  Edit  project_root /jni/Android.mk  to:  Add additional requirements to  LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES :  LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += PluginFacebook\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += sdkbox  Add a call to:  $(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))  before any  import-module  statements.  Add additional  import-module  statements at the end:  $(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginfacebook)  This means that your ordering should look similar to this:  $(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginfacebook)  Note:  It is important to make sure these statements are above the existing  $(call import-module,./prebuilt-mk)  statement, if you are using the pre-built libraries.  Modify  Application.mk  (Cocos2d-x v3.0 to v3.2 only)  Edit  project_root /jni/Application.mk  to make sure  APP_STL  is defined\ncorrectly. If  Application.mk  contains  APP_STL := c++_static , it should be\nchanged to:  APP_STL := gnustl_static  Copy all source and header files from  plugin/jsbindings/  to your projects  Classes  folder.  Add all  .cpp  files, that you just copied, to  Android.mk  in the  LOCAL_SRC_FILES  section. Example  LOCAL_SRC_FILES := hellocpp/main.cpp \\\n                  ../../Classes/AppDelegate.cpp \\\n                  ../../Classes/HelloWorldScene.cpp \\\n                                    ../../Classes/NewSourceFile.cpp  Modify  project.properties  Add following line to your  project.properties  android.library.reference.1=./libs/facebook_lib   Note: if you already have an  android.library.reference.1  you can add\nanother by incrementing the final digit as  android.library.reference.2 , etc.   Modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java    If you're using cocos2d-x from source, assuming you are in the  proj.android  directory,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  is located:  ../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/\nlib/Cocos2dxActivity.java    If you're using the prebuilt cocos2d-x libraries assuming you are in the  proj.android  directory,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  is located:  ./src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java    Note:  When using Cocos2d-x from source, different versions have  Cocos2dxActivity.java  in a different location. One way to find the location is to look in  proj.android/project.properties . Example:\n   android.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java  In this case,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  should be located at:  ../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java   Modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to add the following imports:   import android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;   Second, modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to edit the  onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)  function to add a call to  SDKBox.init(this); . The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to  onLoadNativeLibraries(); . Example:   onLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);    Last, we need to insert the proper  overrides  code. There are a few rules here.    If the method listed has not been defined,  add it .    If the method listed has been defined, add the calls to  SDKBox  in the  same  existing function.          @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }",

The API call is \ninviteFriends()\n passing in a URL for \napp\n and a \npreview image\n. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:inviteFriends(\n \nhttps://fb.me/322164761287181\n,\n \nhttp://www.cocos2d-x.org/attachments/801/cocos2dx_portrait.png\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Contrary to what it may seem the \napp link url\n, it is not an App Store or Google Play application url. You must follow the instructions on this \npage\n  and use the resulting url as the \napp_link_url\n parameter. Facebook hosts this file for the developer, but anyone could host their own file using this \nformat\n\n\n\n\nCreating a \ncustom invite dialog\n is a two step process, starting with a call to \nrequestInvitableFriends()\n then a call to \ninviteFriendsWithInviteIds()\n to actually send the invites. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:inviteFriendsWithInviteIds({}, \u201ctitle\n, \u201cinvitation text\n);\n\n\n\n\nThe \nrequestInvitableFriends()\n function has a \nBundle(map\n)\n parameter, where the developer can define a few flags:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlag\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfields\n\n\na comma separated values of the fields you want to get from your invitable friend\u2019s profiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexclude_ids\n\n\na comma separated FB ids to exclude from the result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlimit\n\n\nnumber of friends per page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA call to \nrequestInvitableFriends()\n will return a different collection of friends per call, and it is Facebook's decision which ones to return first.\nThis function returns a \nFBInvitableFriendsInfo\n object, which will contain a collection of the friends data and a pagination cursor object which has URLS for requesting the next and previous page of invitable friends.\n\n\nThe \ncustom invite dialog\n is only available for games with a \ncanvas implementation\n for the Facebook application. The \ncanvas\n must be defined but doesn't need to how any web content. If the \ncanvas\n is not defined a \nstandard invite dialog\n is used instead.\n\n\nGraph API\n\n\nYou can perform \nGraph API\n using \napi\n function\n\n\nFor example, to get the friend list:\n\n\nlocal params;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:api(\n/me/friendlists\n, \nGET\n, params, \n/me/friendlists\n);\n\n\n\n\nFacebook events\n\n\nThis allows you to catch \nFacebook\n events so that you can perform operations after Facebook events have occurred.\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:setListener(function(args)\n    if \nonLogin\n == args.name then\n        local isLogin = args.isLogin;\n        local msg = args.msg;\n    elseif \nonPermission\n ==  args.name then\n        local isLogin = args.isLogin;\n        local msg = args.msg;\n    elseif \nonAPI\n ==  args.name then\n        local tag = args.tag;\n        local jsonData = args.jsonData;\n    elseif \nonSharedSuccess\n ==  args.name then\n        local msg = args.message\n    elseif \nonSharedFailed\n ==  args.name then\n        local msg = args.message\n    elseif \nonSharedCancel\n ==  args.name then\n    end\nend)\n\n\n\n\nAPI Reference\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:init()\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitialize the plugin instance.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:login()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog in\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:requestReadPermissions(permissions)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog in with specific read permissions, conflict with publish permissions\nhttps://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:requestPublishPermissions(permissions)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog in with specific public permissions\nhttps://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:logout()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog out\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:isLoggedIn()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck whether the user logined or not\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:getUserID()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nget UserID\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:getAccessToken()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nget AccessToken\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:getPermissionList()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nget permissoin list\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:share(info)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshare\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:dialog(info)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nopen a dialog of Facebook app or WebDialog (dialog with photo only avaible with native Facebook app)\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:getSDKVersion()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreturn the version of Facebook SDK\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:fetchFriends()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfetch friends data from Facebook\n\n\n\n\nListeners\n\n\nonLogin(isLogin, msg)\n\n\n\n\nonSharedSuccess(message)\n\n\n\n\nonSharedFailed(message)\n\n\n\n\nonSharedCancel()\n\n\n\n\nonAPI(key, jsonData)\n\n\n\n\nonPermission(isLogin, msg)\n\n\n\n\nonFetchFriends(ok, msg)\n\n\n\n\nManual Integration\n\n\nIf the \nSDKBOX Installer\n \nfails\n to complete successfully, it is possible to integrate SDKBOX manually.

Example:\n  \nandroid.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java\n\n\nIn this case, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n should be located at:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to add the following imports:\n\n\n\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, modify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to edit the \nonCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)\n function to add a call to \nSDKBox.init(this);\n. The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to \nonLoadNativeLibraries();\n. Example:\n\n\n\n\nonLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code. There are a few rules here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has not been defined, \nadd it\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has been defined, add the calls to \nSDKBox\n in the \nsame\n existing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nProguard (optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file. Example:\n\n\n\n\nproguard.config=${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt:proguard-project.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the file you specified to include the following:\n\n\n\n\n# facebook\n-keep public class com.facebook.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.facebook.**\n\n# cocos2d-x\n-keep public class org.cocos2dx.** { *; }\n-dontwarn org.cocos2dx.**\n-keep public class com.chukong.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.chukong.**\n\n# google play service\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.** { public *; }\n-dontwarn com.google.android.gms.**\n\n-keep class * extends java.util.ListResourceBundle {\n    protected Object[][] getContents();\n}\n\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.common.internal.safeparcel.SafeParcelable {\n    public static final *** NULL;\n}\n\n-keepnames @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName class *\n-keepclassmembernames class * {\n    @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName *;\n}\n\n-keepnames class * implements android.os.Parcelable {\n    public static final ** CREATOR;\n}\n\n#sdkbox\n-keep class com.sdkbox.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.sdkbox.**\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Proguard only works with \nRelease\n builds (i.e \ncocos run -m release\n) debug builds do not invoke Proguard rules.",

This can be done anyplace, however it must be done before trying to use the plugin's features.  sdkbox.PluginFacebook:init();  Using Facebook  Login  First the user needs to login to Facebook in order to use it.  sdkbox.PluginFacebook:login();  If a user doesn't want to use Facebook functionality anymore, logout. using  sdkbox.PluginFacebook:logout();  You can check whether user already logged in using  sdkbox.PluginFacebook:isLoggedIn();   Note: user only needs to perform login once, unless they logout   Permissions  Facebook requires you to ask for the user's permission before you can perform actions, such as, posting on the user's behalf.\nThere are two types of permission  read  and  publish \nYou can get a complete list of permissions  here  SDKBOX provides the most commonly used permissions:   FB_PERM_READ_PUBLIC_PROFILE  FB_PERM_READ_EMAIL  FB_PERM_READ_USER_FRIENDS  FB_PERM_PUBLISH_POST   To request a permission, you do so by specifying what you want:  sdkbox.PluginFacebook:requestReadPermissions({FB_PERM_READ_PUBLIC_PROFILE, FB_PERM_READ_USER_FRIENDS});\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:requestPublishPermissions({FB_PERM_PUBLISH_POST});  Share  There are two types of sharing functionality.   share  will automatically post to the user's wall\nshare a link:   local info;\ninfo.type  =  link ;\ninfo.link  =  http://www.cocos2d-x.org ;\ninfo.title =  cocos2d-x ;\ninfo.text  =  Best Game Engine ;\ninfo.image =  http://cocos2d-x.org/images/logo.png ;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:share(info);  share a photo:  local info;\ninfo.type  =  photo ;\ninfo.title =  My Photo ;\ninfo.image = __path to image__;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:share(info);   dialog  will show a dialog and prompt the user to write their own comments in addition:   present a share dialog:  local info;\ninfo.type  =  link ;\ninfo.link  =  http://www.cocos2d-x.org ;\ninfo.title =  cocos2d-x ;\ninfo.text  =  Best Game Engine ;\ninfo.image =  http://cocos2d-x.org/images/logo.png ;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:dialog(info);  share a photo with comments:  local info;\ninfo.type  =  photo ;\ninfo.title =  My Photo ;\ninfo.image = __path to image__;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:dialog(info);   Note: sharing photo with comments requires the  Facebook app  to be installed on the device.   Invite  There are both  standard  and  custom   Invite  dialogs available to use when inviting your Friends.  When using the  standard invite dialog , it is necessary to select the friends to send the invitation request too. The API call is  inviteFriends()  passing in a URL for  app  and a  preview image . Example:  sdkbox.PluginFacebook:inviteFriends(\n  https://fb.me/322164761287181 ,\n  http://www.cocos2d-x.org/attachments/801/cocos2dx_portrait.png );   Note: Contrary to what it may seem the  app link url , it is not an App Store or Google Play application url. You must follow the instructions on this  page   and use the resulting url as the  app_link_url  parameter. Facebook hosts this file for the developer, but anyone could host their own file using this  format   Creating a  custom invite dialog  is a two step process, starting with a call to  requestInvitableFriends()  then a call to  inviteFriendsWithInviteIds()  to actually send the invites. Example:  sdkbox.PluginFacebook:inviteFriendsWithInviteIds({}, \u201ctitle , \u201cinvitation text );  The  requestInvitableFriends()  function has a  Bundle(map )  parameter, where the developer can define a few flags:     Flag  Description      fields  a comma separated values of the fields you want to get from your invitable friend\u2019s profiles.    exclude_ids  a comma separated FB ids to exclude from the result.    limit  number of friends per page.     A call to  requestInvitableFriends()  will return a different collection of friends per call, and it is Facebook's decision which ones to return first.\nThis function returns a  FBInvitableFriendsInfo  object, which will contain a collection of the friends data and a pagination cursor object which has URLS for requesting the next and previous page of invitable friends.  The  custom invite dialog  is only available for games with a  canvas implementation  for the Facebook application. The  canvas  must be defined but doesn't need to how any web content. If the  canvas  is not defined a  standard invite dialog  is used instead.  Graph API  You can perform  Graph API  using  api  function  For example, to get the friend list:  local params;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:api( /me/friendlists ,  GET , params,  /me/friendlists );  Facebook events  This allows you to catch  Facebook  events so that you can perform operations after Facebook events have occurred.  sdkbox.PluginFacebook:setListener(function(args)\n    if  onLogin  == args.name then\n        local isLogin = args.isLogin;\n        local msg = args.msg;\n    elseif  onPermission  ==  args.name then\n        local isLogin = args.isLogin;\n        local msg = args.msg;\n    elseif  onAPI  ==  args.name then\n        local tag = args.tag;\n        local jsonData = args.jsonData;\n    elseif  onSharedSuccess  ==  args.name then\n        local msg = args.message\n    elseif  onSharedFailed  ==  args.name then\n        local msg = args.message\n    elseif  onSharedCancel  ==  args.name then\n    end\nend)",

Note: sdkbox link with  gnustl  by default, if your project link with  c++static  please replace the files in  project_root /jni/ plugin_name /libs  with files in  project_root /jni/ plugin_name /libs_c++_static  folder   Edit  AndroidManifest.xml  Include the following permissions above the  application tag :     uses-permission android:name= android.permission.INTERNET  /   There are also a few necessary meta-data tags that also need to be added:  meta-data android:name= com.facebook.sdk.ApplicationId  android:value= @string/facebook_app_id /  activity android:name= com.facebook.FacebookActivity \n  android:configChanges=\n          keyboard|keyboardHidden|screenLayout|screenSize|orientation \n  android:theme= @android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar \n  android:label= @string/app_name  / \n\n   provider android:authorities= com.facebook.app.FacebookContentProvider__replace_with_your_app_id__ \n  android:name= com.facebook.FacebookContentProvider \n  android:exported= true  /   Edit strings.xml  Open  res/values/strings.xml , Add a new string with the name facebook_app_id  and value as your Facebook App ID. Example:     ?xml version= 1.0  encoding= utf-8 ? \n   resources \n       string name= app_name facebook /string \n       string name= facebook_app_id 280194012150923 /string \n   /resources   Edit  Android.mk  Edit  project_root /jni/Android.mk  to:  Add additional requirements to  LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES :  LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += PluginFacebook\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += sdkbox  Add a call to:  $(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))  before any  import-module  statements.  Add additional  import-module  statements at the end:  $(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginfacebook)  This means that your ordering should look similar to this:  $(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginfacebook)  Note:  It is important to make sure these statements are above the existing  $(call import-module,./prebuilt-mk)  statement, if you are using the pre-built libraries.  Modify  Application.mk  (Cocos2d-x v3.0 to v3.2 only)  Edit  project_root /jni/Application.mk  to make sure  APP_STL  is defined\ncorrectly. If  Application.mk  contains  APP_STL := c++_static , it should be\nchanged to:  APP_STL := gnustl_static  Copy all source and header files from  plugin/luabindings/  to your projects  Classes  folder.  Add all  .cpp  files, that you just copied, to  Android.mk  in the  LOCAL_SRC_FILES  section. Example  LOCAL_SRC_FILES := hellocpp/main.cpp \\\n                ../../Classes/AppDelegate.cpp \\\n                ../../Classes/HelloWorldScene.cpp \\\n                                ../../Classes/NewSourceFile.cpp  Modify  project.properties  Add following line to your  project.properties  android.library.reference.1=./libs/facebook_lib   Note: if you already have an  android.library.reference.1  you can add\nanother by incrementing the final digit as  android.library.reference.2 , etc.   Modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java    If you're using cocos2d-x from source, assuming you are in the  proj.android  directory,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  is located:  ../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/\nlib/Cocos2dxActivity.java    If you're using the prebuilt cocos2d-x libraries assuming you are in the  proj.android  directory,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  is located:  ./src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java    Note:  When using Cocos2d-x from source, different versions have  Cocos2dxActivity.java  in a different location. One way to find the location is to look in  proj.android/project.properties . Example:\n   android.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java  In this case,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  should be located at:  ../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java   Modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to add the following imports:   import android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;   Second, modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to edit the  onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)  function to add a call to  SDKBox.init(this); . The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to  onLoadNativeLibraries(); . Example:   onLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);    Last, we need to insert the proper  overrides  code. There are a few rules here.    If the method listed has not been defined,  add it .    If the method listed has been defined, add the calls to  SDKBox  in the  same  existing function.          @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }",

The API call is \ninviteFriends()\n passing in an \napp link url\n and a \npreview image\n. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox::PluginFacebook::inviteFriends(\n  \nhttps://fb.me/322164761287181\n,\n  \nhttp://www.cocos2d-x.org/attachments/801/cocos2dx_portrait.png\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Contrary to what it may seem the \napp link url\n, it is not an App Store or Google Play application url. You must follow the instructions on this \npage\n  and use the resulting url as the \napp_link_url\n parameter. Facebook hosts this file for the developer, but anyone could host their own file using this \nformat\n\n\n\n\nAt runtime, a custom message can be attached to the invite request. It is not possible to set a predefined invite message.\n\n\nCreating a \ncustom invite dialog\n is a two step process, starting with a call to \nrequestInvitableFriends()\n then a call to \ninviteFriendsWithInviteIds()\n to actually send the invites. Example:\n\n\nstd::vector\nstd::string\n vec;\nvec.push_back(invitable_token);\nsdkbox::PluginFacebook::inviteFriendsWithInviteIds(vec, \nInvitation title\n, \nInvitation text up to 60 chars.\n);\n\n\n\n\nThe \nrequestInvitableFriends()\n function has a \nBundle(map\n)\n parameter, where the developer can define a few flags:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlag\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfields\n\n\na comma separated values of the fields you want to get from your invitable friend\u2019s profiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexclude_ids\n\n\na comma separated FB ids to exclude from the result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlimit\n\n\nnumber of friends per page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA call to \nrequestInvitableFriends()\n will return a different collection of friends per call, and it is Facebook's decision which ones to return first.\nThis function returns a \nFBInvitableFriendsInfo\n object, which will contain a collection of the friends data and a pagination cursor object which has URLS for requesting the next and previous page of invitable friends.\n\n\nThe \ncustom invite dialog\n is only available for games with a \ncanvas implementation\n for the Facebook application. The \ncanvas\n must be defined but doesn't need to how any web content. If the \ncanvas\n is not defined a \nstandard invite dialog\n is used instead.\n\n\nGraph API\n\n\nYou can perform \nGraph API\n using the \napi\n function\n\n\nFor example, to get the friend list:\n\n\nsdkbox::PluginFacebook::FBAPIParam params;\nsdkbox::PluginFacebook::api(\n/me/friendlists\n, \nGET\n, params, \n/me/friendlists\n);\n\n\n\n\nFacebook events\n\n\nThis allows you to catch \nFacebook\n events so that you can perform operations after Facebook events have occurred.\n\n\n\n\nAllow your class to extend \nsdkbox::FacebookListener\n and override the functions listed:\n\n\n\n\n#include \nPluginFacebook/PluginFacebook.h\n\nclass MyClass : public sdkbox::FacebookListener\n{\nprivate:\n  void onLogin(bool isLogin, const std::string\n msg);\n  void onPermission(bool isLogin, const std::string\n msg);\n  void onAPI(const std::string\n tag, const std::string\n jsonData);\n  void onSharedSuccess(const std::string\n message);\n  void onSharedFailed(const std::string\n message);\n  void onSharedCancel();\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a \nlistener\n that handles callbacks:\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox::PluginFacebook::setListener(this);\n\n\n\n\nAPI

Example of what this might look like for you:\n\n\n\n\nprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState){\n  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n  SDKBox.init(this);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code. There are a few rules here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has not been defined, \nadd it\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has been defined, add the calls to \nSDKBox\n in the \nsame\n existing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nProguard (optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file. Example:\n\n\n\n\nproguard.config=${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt:proguard-project.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the file you specified to include the following:\n\n\n\n\n# facebook\n-keep public class com.facebook.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.facebook.**\n\n# cocos2d-x\n-keep public class org.cocos2dx.** { *; }\n-dontwarn org.cocos2dx.**\n-keep public class com.chukong.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.chukong.**\n\n# google play service\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.** { public *; }\n-dontwarn com.google.android.gms.**\n\n-keep class * extends java.util.ListResourceBundle {\n    protected Object[][] getContents();\n}\n\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.common.internal.safeparcel.SafeParcelable {\n    public static final *** NULL;\n}\n\n-keepnames @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName class *\n-keepclassmembernames class * {\n    @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName *;\n}\n\n-keepnames class * implements android.os.Parcelable {\n    public static final ** CREATOR;\n}\n\n#sdkbox\n-keep class com.sdkbox.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.sdkbox.**\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Proguard only works with \nRelease\n builds (i.e \ncocos run -m release\n) debug builds do not invoke Proguard rules.",

Make sure to include the appropriate headers:  #include  PluginFacebook/PluginFacebook.h \nAppDelegate::applicationDidFinishLaunching()\n{\n     sdkbox::PluginFacebook::init();\n}  Using Facebook  Login  First the user needs to login to Facebook in order to use it.  sdkbox::PluginFacebook::login();  If a user doesn't want to use Facebook functionality anymore, logout.  sdkbox::PluginFacebook::logout();  You can check whether user already logged in using  sdkbox::PluginFacebook::isLoggedIn();   Note: user only needs to perform login once, unless they logout   Permissions  Facebook requires you to ask for the user's permission before you can perform actions, such as, posting on the user's behalf.\nThere are two types of permission  read  and  publish \nYou can get a complete list of permissions  here  SDKBOX provides the most commonly used permissions:   FB_PERM_READ_PUBLIC_PROFILE  FB_PERM_READ_EMAIL  FB_PERM_READ_USER_FRIENDS  FB_PERM_PUBLISH_POST   To request a permission, you do so by specifying what you want:  sdkbox::PluginFacebook::requestReadPermissions({FB_PERM_READ_PUBLIC_PROFILE, FB_PERM_READ_USER_FRIENDS});\nsdkbox::PluginFacebook::requestPublishPermissions({FB_PERM_PUBLISH_POST});  Share  There are two types of sharing functionality.   share  will automatically post to the user's wall\nshare a link:   sdkbox::FBShareInfo info;\ninfo.type  = sdkbox::FB_LINK;\ninfo.link  =  http://www.cocos2d-x.org ;\ninfo.title =  cocos2d-x ;\ninfo.text  =  Best Game Engine ;\ninfo.image =  http://cocos2d-x.org/images/logo.png ;\nsdkbox::PluginFacebook::share(info);  share a photo:  sdkbox::FBShareInfo info;\ninfo.type  = sdkbox::FB_PHOTO;\ninfo.title =  My Photo ;\ninfo.image = __path to image__;\nsdkbox::PluginFacebook::share(info);   dialog  will show a dialog and prompt the user to write their own comments in addition:   present a share dialog:  sdkbox::FBShareInfo info;\ninfo.type  = sdkbox::FB_LINK;\ninfo.link  =  http://www.cocos2d-x.org ;\ninfo.title =  cocos2d-x ;\ninfo.text  =  Best Game Engine ;\ninfo.image =  http://cocos2d-x.org/images/logo.png ;\nsdkbox::PluginFacebook::dialog(info);  share a photo with comments:  sdkbox::FBShareInfo info;\ninfo.type  = sdkbox::FB_PHOTO;\ninfo.title =  My Photo ;\ninfo.image = __path to image__;\nsdkbox::PluginFacebook::dialog(info);   Note: sharing photo with comments requires the  Facebook app  to be installed on the device.   Invite  There are both  standard  and  custom   Invite  dialogs available to use when inviting your Friends.  When using the  standard invite dialog , it is necessary to select the friends to send the invitation request too. The API call is  inviteFriends()  passing in an  app link url  and a  preview image . Example:  sdkbox::PluginFacebook::inviteFriends(\n   https://fb.me/322164761287181 ,\n   http://www.cocos2d-x.org/attachments/801/cocos2dx_portrait.png );   Note: Contrary to what it may seem the  app link url , it is not an App Store or Google Play application url. You must follow the instructions on this  page   and use the resulting url as the  app_link_url  parameter. Facebook hosts this file for the developer, but anyone could host their own file using this  format   At runtime, a custom message can be attached to the invite request. It is not possible to set a predefined invite message.  Creating a  custom invite dialog  is a two step process, starting with a call to  requestInvitableFriends()  then a call to  inviteFriendsWithInviteIds()  to actually send the invites. Example:  std::vector std::string  vec;\nvec.push_back(invitable_token);\nsdkbox::PluginFacebook::inviteFriendsWithInviteIds(vec,  Invitation title ,  Invitation text up to 60 chars. );  The  requestInvitableFriends()  function has a  Bundle(map )  parameter, where the developer can define a few flags:     Flag  Description      fields  a comma separated values of the fields you want to get from your invitable friend\u2019s profiles.    exclude_ids  a comma separated FB ids to exclude from the result.    limit  number of friends per page.     A call to  requestInvitableFriends()  will return a different collection of friends per call, and it is Facebook's decision which ones to return first.\nThis function returns a  FBInvitableFriendsInfo  object, which will contain a collection of the friends data and a pagination cursor object which has URLS for requesting the next and previous page of invitable friends.  The  custom invite dialog  is only available for games with a  canvas implementation  for the Facebook application. The  canvas  must be defined but doesn't need to how any web content. If the  canvas  is not defined a  standard invite dialog  is used instead.  Graph API  You can perform  Graph API  using the  api  function  For example, to get the friend list:  sdkbox::PluginFacebook::FBAPIParam params;\nsdkbox::PluginFacebook::api( /me/friendlists ,  GET , params,  /me/friendlists );  Facebook events  This allows you to catch  Facebook  events so that you can perform operations after Facebook events have occurred.   Allow your class to extend  sdkbox::FacebookListener  and override the functions listed:   #include  PluginFacebook/PluginFacebook.h \nclass MyClass : public sdkbox::FacebookListener\n{\nprivate:\n  void onLogin(bool isLogin, const std::string  msg);\n  void onPermission(bool isLogin, const std::string  msg);\n  void onAPI(const std::string  tag, const std::string  jsonData);\n  void onSharedSuccess(const std::string  message);\n  void onSharedFailed(const std::string  message);\n  void onSharedCancel();\n};   Create a  listener  that handles callbacks:   sdkbox::PluginFacebook::setListener(this);",

We\nrecommend to do this in the \napp.js\n. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.init();\n\n\n\n\nUsing Facebook\n\n\nLogin\n\n\nFirst the user needs to login to Facebook in order to use it.\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.login();\n\n\n\n\nIf a user doesn't want to use Facebook functionality anymore, logout. using\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.logout();\n\n\n\n\nYou can check whether user already logged in using\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.isLoggedIn();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: user only needs to perform login once, unless they logout\n\n\n\n\nPermissions\n\n\nFacebook requires you to ask for the user's permission before you can perform actions, such as, posting on the user's behalf.\nThere are two types of permission \nread\n and \npublish\n\nYou can get a complete list of permissions \nhere\n\n\nTo request a permission, you do so by specifying what you want:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.requestReadPermissions([\npublic_profile\n, \nemail\n]);\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.requestPublishPermissions([\npublish_actions\n]);\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\nThere are two types of sharing functionality.\n\n\n\n\nshare\n will automatically post to the users wall\nshare a link:\n\n\n\n\nvar info = new Object();\ninfo.type  = \nlink\n;\ninfo.link  = \nhttp://www.cocos2d-x.org\n;\ninfo.title = \ncocos2d-x\n;\ninfo.text  = \nBest Game Engine\n;\ninfo.image = \nhttp://cocos2d-x.org/images/logo.png\n;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.share(info);\n\n\n\n\nshare a photo:\n\n\nvar info = new Object();\ninfo.type  = \nphoto\n;\ninfo.title = \nMy Photo\n;\ninfo.image = __path to image__;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.share(info);\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndialog\n will show a dialog and prompt the user to write their own comments in addition:\n\n\n\n\npresent a share dialog:\n\n\nvar info = new Object();\ninfo.type  = \nlink\n;\ninfo.link  = \nhttp://www.cocos2d-x.org\n;\ninfo.title = \ncocos2d-x\n;\ninfo.text  = \nBest Game Engine\n;\ninfo.image = \nhttp://cocos2d-x.org/images/logo.png\n;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.dialog(info);\n\n\n\n\nshare a photo with comments:\n\n\nvar info = new Object();\ninfo.type  = \nphoto\n;\ninfo.title = \nMy Photo\n;\ninfo.image = __path to image__;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.dialog(info);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: sharing photo with comments requires the \nFacebook app\n to be installed on the device.\n\n\n\n\nInvite\n\n\nThere are both \nstandard\n and \ncustom\n \nInvite\n dialogs available to use when inviting your Friends.\n\n\nWhen using the \nstandard invite dialog\n, it is necessary to select the friends to send the invitation request too. The API call is \ninviteFriends()\n passing in a URL for \napp\n and a \npreview image\n. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.inviteFriends(\n \nhttps://fb.me/322164761287181\n,\n \nhttp://www.cocos2d-x.org/attachments/801/cocos2dx_portrait.png\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Contrary to what it may seem the \napp link url\n, it is not an App Store or Google Play application url. You must follow the instructions on this \npage\n  and use the resulting url as the \napp_link_url\n parameter. Facebook hosts this file for the developer, but anyone could host their own file using this \nformat\n\n\n\n\nCreating a \ncustom invite dialog\n is a two step process, starting with a call to \nrequestInvitableFriends()\n then a call to \ninviteFriendsWithInviteIds()\n to actually send the invites. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.inviteFriendsWithInviteIds([], \u201ctitle\n, \u201cinvitation text\n);\n\n\n\n\nThe \nrequestInvitableFriends()\n function has a \nBundle(map\n)\n parameter, where the developer can define a few flags:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlag\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfields\n\n\na comma separated values of the fields you want to get from your invitable friend\u2019s profiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexclude_ids\n\n\na comma separated FB ids to exclude from the result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlimit\n\n\nnumber of friends per page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA call to \nrequestInvitableFriends()\n will return a different collection of friends per call, and it is Facebook's decision which ones to return first.\nThis function returns a \nFBInvitableFriendsInfo\n object, which will contain a collection of the friends data and a pagination cursor object which has URLS for requesting the next and previous page of invitable friends.\n\n\nThe \ncustom invite dialog\n is only available for games with a \ncanvas implementation\n for the Facebook application. The \ncanvas\n must be defined but doesn't need to how any web content. If the \ncanvas\n is not defined a \nstandard invite dialog\n is used instead.\n\n\nGraph API\n\n\nYou can perform \nGraph API\n using the \napi\n function\n\n\nFor example, to get the friend list:\n\n\nvar params = new Object();\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.api(\n/me/friendlists\n, \nGET\n, params, \n/me/friendlists\n);\n\n\n\n\nFacebook events\n\n\nThis allows you to catch \nFacebook\n events so that you can perform operations after Facebook events have occurred.\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.setListener({\n    onLogin: function(isLogin, msg) {},\n    onAPI: function(tag, data) {},\n    onSharedSuccess: function(data) {},\n    onSharedFailed: function(data) {},\n    onSharedCancel: function() {},\n    onPermission: function(isLogin, msg) {}\n});\n\n\n\n\nAPI Reference\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.init();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitialize the plugin instance.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.login();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog in\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.requestReadPermissions(permissions);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog in with specific read permissions, conflict with publish permissions\nhttps://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.requestPublishPermissions(permissions);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog in with specific public permissions\nhttps://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.logout();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog out\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.isLoggedIn();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck whether the user logined or not\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.getUserID();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nget UserID\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.getAccessToken();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nget AccessToken\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.getPermissionList();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nget permissoin list\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.share(info);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshare\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.dialog(info);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nopen a dialog of Facebook app or WebDialog (dialog with photo only avaible with native Facebook app)\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.getSDKVersion();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreturn the version of Facebook SDK\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.fetchFriends();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfetch friends data from Facebook\n\n\n\n\nListeners\n\n\nonLogin(isLogin, msg);\n\n\n\n\nonSharedSuccess(message);\n\n\n\n\nonSharedFailed(message);\n\n\n\n\nonSharedCancel();\n\n\n\n\nonAPI(key, jsonData);\n\n\n\n\nonPermission(isLogin, msg);\n\n\n\n\nonFetchFriends(ok, msg);\n\n\n\n\nManual Integration\n\n\nIf the \nSDKBOX Installer\n \nfails\n to complete successfully, it is possible to integrate SDKBOX manually. If the installer complete successfully, please \ndo not\n complete anymore of this document. It is not necessary.\n\n\nThese steps are listed last in this document on purpose as they are seldom needed. If you find yourself using these steps, please, after completing, double back and re-read the steps above for other integration items.\n\n\nManual Integration For iOS\n\n\nDrag and drop the following frameworks from the \nplugins/ios\n folder of\nthe\nFacebook\n bundle into your Xcode project, check \nCopy items if needed\n when adding frameworks:\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.framework\n\n\nPluginFacebook.framework\n\n\n\n\nThe above frameworks depend upon a large number of other frameworks. You also need to add the following system frameworks, if you don't already have them:\n\n\n\n\nSecurity.framework\n\n\nAdSupport.framework\n\n\n\n\nCopy all source and header files from \nplugin/jsbindings/\n to your projects \nClasses\n folder.\n\n\nAdd these same files, that you just copied, to Xcode by either dragging and dropping them into Xcode or by using \nFile -\n Add files to...\n.\n\n\nManual Integration For Android\n\n\nSDKBOX supports three different kinds of \nAndroid\n projects \ncommand-line\n, \neclipse\n and \nAndroid Studio\n. \n\n\n\n\nproj.android\n will be used as our \nproject_root\n for \ncommand-line\n and \neclipse\n project\n\n\nproj.android-studio\n will be used as our \nproject_root\n for \nAndroid Studio\n project.\n\n\n\n\nCopy Files\n\n\nCopy the following \njar\n files from \nplugin/android/libs\n folder of this\nbundle into your project\u2019s \nproj.android/libs\n folder.\n\n\n\n\nPluginFacebook.jar\n\n\nsdkbox.jar\n\n\n\n\nCopy the \nfacebook_lib\n directories from \nplugin/android/libs\n to your \nproj.android/libs/\n directory.\n\n\nCopy jni libs\n\n\nCopy and overwrite all the folders from \nplugin/android/jni\n\nto your \nproject_root\n/jni/\n directory.\n\n\n\n\nNote: sdkbox link with \ngnustl\n by default, if your project link with \nc++static\n please replace the files in \nproject_root\n/jni/\nplugin_name\n/libs\n with files in \nproject_root\n/jni/\nplugin_name\n/libs_c++_static\n folder\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nAndroidManifest.xml\n\n\nInclude the following permissions above the \napplication tag\n:\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.INTERNET\n /\n\n\n\n\n\nTo enable \nhardware acceleration\n in your \napplication tag\n.

            "text": "Register Javascript Functions  You need to register all the Facebook JS functions with cocos2d-x before using them.  To do this:\n* Modify  ./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp  to include the following headers:  #include  PluginFacebookJS.hpp \n#include  PluginFacebookJSHelper.h    Modify  ./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp  make sure to call:   sc- addRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginFacebookJS);\nsc- addRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginFacebookJS_helper);  Initialize Facebook  Initialize the plugin by calling  init()  where appropriate in your code. We\nrecommend to do this in the  app.js . Example:  sdkbox.PluginFacebook.init();  Using Facebook  Login  First the user needs to login to Facebook in order to use it.  sdkbox.PluginFacebook.login();  If a user doesn't want to use Facebook functionality anymore, logout. using  sdkbox.PluginFacebook.logout();  You can check whether user already logged in using  sdkbox.PluginFacebook.isLoggedIn();   Note: user only needs to perform login once, unless they logout   Permissions  Facebook requires you to ask for the user's permission before you can perform actions, such as, posting on the user's behalf.\nThere are two types of permission  read  and  publish \nYou can get a complete list of permissions  here  To request a permission, you do so by specifying what you want:  sdkbox.PluginFacebook.requestReadPermissions([ public_profile ,  email ]);\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.requestPublishPermissions([ publish_actions ]);  Share  There are two types of sharing functionality.   share  will automatically post to the users wall\nshare a link:   var info = new Object();\ninfo.type  =  link ;\ninfo.link  =  http://www.cocos2d-x.org ;\ninfo.title =  cocos2d-x ;\ninfo.text  =  Best Game Engine ;\ninfo.image =  http://cocos2d-x.org/images/logo.png ;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.share(info);  share a photo:  var info = new Object();\ninfo.type  =  photo ;\ninfo.title =  My Photo ;\ninfo.image = __path to image__;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.share(info);   dialog  will show a dialog and prompt the user to write their own comments in addition:   present a share dialog:  var info = new Object();\ninfo.type  =  link ;\ninfo.link  =  http://www.cocos2d-x.org ;\ninfo.title =  cocos2d-x ;\ninfo.text  =  Best Game Engine ;\ninfo.image =  http://cocos2d-x.org/images/logo.png ;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.dialog(info);  share a photo with comments:  var info = new Object();\ninfo.type  =  photo ;\ninfo.title =  My Photo ;\ninfo.image = __path to image__;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.dialog(info);   Note: sharing photo with comments requires the  Facebook app  to be installed on the device.   Invite  There are both  standard  and  custom   Invite  dialogs available to use when inviting your Friends.  When using the  standard invite dialog , it is necessary to select the friends to send the invitation request too. The API call is  inviteFriends()  passing in a URL for  app  and a  preview image . Example:  sdkbox.PluginFacebook.inviteFriends(\n  https://fb.me/322164761287181 ,\n  http://www.cocos2d-x.org/attachments/801/cocos2dx_portrait.png );   Note: Contrary to what it may seem the  app link url , it is not an App Store or Google Play application url. You must follow the instructions on this  page   and use the resulting url as the  app_link_url  parameter. Facebook hosts this file for the developer, but anyone could host their own file using this  format   Creating a  custom invite dialog  is a two step process, starting with a call to  requestInvitableFriends()  then a call to  inviteFriendsWithInviteIds()  to actually send the invites. Example:  sdkbox.PluginFacebook.inviteFriendsWithInviteIds([], \u201ctitle , \u201cinvitation text );  The  requestInvitableFriends()  function has a  Bundle(map )  parameter, where the developer can define a few flags:     Flag  Description      fields  a comma separated values of the fields you want to get from your invitable friend\u2019s profiles.    exclude_ids  a comma separated FB ids to exclude from the result.    limit  number of friends per page.     A call to  requestInvitableFriends()  will return a different collection of friends per call, and it is Facebook's decision which ones to return first.\nThis function returns a  FBInvitableFriendsInfo  object, which will contain a collection of the friends data and a pagination cursor object which has URLS for requesting the next and previous page of invitable friends.  The  custom invite dialog  is only available for games with a  canvas implementation  for the Facebook application. The  canvas  must be defined but doesn't need to how any web content. If the  canvas  is not defined a  standard invite dialog  is used instead.  Graph API  You can perform  Graph API  using the  api  function  For example, to get the friend list:  var params = new Object();\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook.api( /me/friendlists ,  GET , params,  /me/friendlists );  Facebook events  This allows you to catch  Facebook  events so that you can perform operations after Facebook events have occurred.  sdkbox.PluginFacebook.setListener({\n    onLogin: function(isLogin, msg) {},\n    onAPI: function(tag, data) {},\n    onSharedSuccess: function(data) {},\n    onSharedFailed: function(data) {},\n    onSharedCancel: function() {},\n    onPermission: function(isLogin, msg) {}\n});",

This can be done anyplace, however it must be done before trying to use the plugin's features.\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:init();\n\n\n\n\nUsing Facebook\n\n\nLogin\n\n\nFirst the user needs to login to Facebook in order to use it.\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:login();\n\n\n\n\nIf a user doesn't want to use Facebook functionality anymore, logout. using\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:logout();\n\n\n\n\nYou can check whether user already logged in using\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:isLoggedIn();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: user only needs to perform login once, unless they logout\n\n\n\n\nPermissions\n\n\nFacebook requires you to ask for the user's permission before you can perform actions, such as, posting on the user's behalf.\nThere are two types of permission \nread\n and \npublish\n\nYou can get a complete list of permissions \nhere\n\n\nSDKBOX provides the most commonly used permissions:\n\n\n\n\nFB_PERM_READ_PUBLIC_PROFILE\n\n\nFB_PERM_READ_EMAIL\n\n\nFB_PERM_READ_USER_FRIENDS\n\n\nFB_PERM_PUBLISH_POST\n\n\n\n\nTo request a permission, you do so by specifying what you want:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:requestReadPermissions({FB_PERM_READ_PUBLIC_PROFILE, FB_PERM_READ_USER_FRIENDS});\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:requestPublishPermissions({FB_PERM_PUBLISH_POST});\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\nThere are two types of sharing functionality.\n\n\n\n\nshare\n will automatically post to the user's wall\nshare a link:\n\n\n\n\nlocal info;\ninfo.type  = \nlink\n;\ninfo.link  = \nhttp://www.cocos2d-x.org\n;\ninfo.title = \ncocos2d-x\n;\ninfo.text  = \nBest Game Engine\n;\ninfo.image = \nhttp://cocos2d-x.org/images/logo.png\n;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:share(info);\n\n\n\n\nshare a photo:\n\n\nlocal info;\ninfo.type  = \nphoto\n;\ninfo.title = \nMy Photo\n;\ninfo.image = __path to image__;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:share(info);\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndialog\n will show a dialog and prompt the user to write their own comments in addition:\n\n\n\n\npresent a share dialog:\n\n\nlocal info;\ninfo.type  = \nlink\n;\ninfo.link  = \nhttp://www.cocos2d-x.org\n;\ninfo.title = \ncocos2d-x\n;\ninfo.text  = \nBest Game Engine\n;\ninfo.image = \nhttp://cocos2d-x.org/images/logo.png\n;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:dialog(info);\n\n\n\n\nshare a photo with comments:\n\n\nlocal info;\ninfo.type  = \nphoto\n;\ninfo.title = \nMy Photo\n;\ninfo.image = __path to image__;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:dialog(info);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: sharing photo with comments requires the \nFacebook app\n to be installed on the device.\n\n\n\n\nInvite\n\n\nThere are both \nstandard\n and \ncustom\n \nInvite\n dialogs available to use when inviting your Friends.\n\n\nWhen using the \nstandard invite dialog\n, it is necessary to select the friends to send the invitation request too. The API call is \ninviteFriends()\n passing in a URL for \napp\n and a \npreview image\n. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:inviteFriends(\n \nhttps://fb.me/322164761287181\n,\n \nhttp://www.cocos2d-x.org/attachments/801/cocos2dx_portrait.png\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Contrary to what it may seem the \napp link url\n, it is not an App Store or Google Play application url. You must follow the instructions on this \npage\n  and use the resulting url as the \napp_link_url\n parameter. Facebook hosts this file for the developer, but anyone could host their own file using this \nformat\n\n\n\n\nCreating a \ncustom invite dialog\n is a two step process, starting with a call to \nrequestInvitableFriends()\n then a call to \ninviteFriendsWithInviteIds()\n to actually send the invites. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:inviteFriendsWithInviteIds({}, \u201ctitle\n, \u201cinvitation text\n);\n\n\n\n\nThe \nrequestInvitableFriends()\n function has a \nBundle(map\n)\n parameter, where the developer can define a few flags:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlag\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfields\n\n\na comma separated values of the fields you want to get from your invitable friend\u2019s profiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexclude_ids\n\n\na comma separated FB ids to exclude from the result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlimit\n\n\nnumber of friends per page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA call to \nrequestInvitableFriends()\n will return a different collection of friends per call, and it is Facebook's decision which ones to return first.\nThis function returns a \nFBInvitableFriendsInfo\n object, which will contain a collection of the friends data and a pagination cursor object which has URLS for requesting the next and previous page of invitable friends.\n\n\nThe \ncustom invite dialog\n is only available for games with a \ncanvas implementation\n for the Facebook application. The \ncanvas\n must be defined but doesn't need to how any web content. If the \ncanvas\n is not defined a \nstandard invite dialog\n is used instead.\n\n\nGraph API\n\n\nYou can perform \nGraph API\n using \napi\n function\n\n\nFor example, to get the friend list:\n\n\nlocal params;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:api(\n/me/friendlists\n, \nGET\n, params, \n/me/friendlists\n);\n\n\n\n\nFacebook events\n\n\nThis allows you to catch \nFacebook\n events so that you can perform operations after Facebook events have occurred.\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:setListener(function(args)\n    if \nonLogin\n == args.name then\n        local isLogin = args.isLogin;\n        local msg = args.msg;\n    elseif \nonPermission\n ==  args.name then\n        local isLogin = args.isLogin;\n        local msg = args.msg;\n    elseif \nonAPI\n ==  args.name then\n        local tag = args.tag;\n        local jsonData = args.jsonData;\n    elseif \nonSharedSuccess\n ==  args.name then\n        local msg = args.message\n    elseif \nonSharedFailed\n ==  args.name then\n        local msg = args.message\n    elseif \nonSharedCancel\n ==  args.name then\n    end\nend)\n\n\n\n\nAPI Reference\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:init()\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitialize the plugin instance.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:login()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog in\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:requestReadPermissions(permissions)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog in with specific read permissions, conflict with publish permissions\nhttps://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:requestPublishPermissions(permissions)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog in with specific public permissions\nhttps://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:logout()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog out\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:isLoggedIn()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck whether the user logined or not\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:getUserID()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nget UserID\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:getAccessToken()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nget AccessToken\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:getPermissionList()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nget permissoin list\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:share(info)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshare\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:dialog(info)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nopen a dialog of Facebook app or WebDialog (dialog with photo only avaible with native Facebook app)\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:getSDKVersion()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreturn the version of Facebook SDK\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:fetchFriends()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfetch friends data from Facebook\n\n\n\n\nListeners\n\n\nonLogin(isLogin, msg)\n\n\n\n\nonSharedSuccess(message)\n\n\n\n\nonSharedFailed(message)\n\n\n\n\nonSharedCancel()\n\n\n\n\nonAPI(key, jsonData)\n\n\n\n\nonPermission(isLogin, msg)\n\n\n\n\nonFetchFriends(ok, msg)\n\n\n\n\nManual Integration\n\n\nIf the \nSDKBOX Installer\n \nfails\n to complete successfully, it is possible to integrate SDKBOX manually.

Example of what this might look like for you:\n\n\n\n\nprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState){\n  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n  SDKBox.init(this);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code. There are a few rules here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has not been defined, \nadd it\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has been defined, add the calls to \nSDKBox\n in the \nsame\n existing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nProguard (optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file. Example:\n\n\n\n\nproguard.config=${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt:proguard-project.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the file you specified to include the following:\n\n\n\n\n# facebook\n-keep public class com.facebook.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.facebook.**\n\n# cocos2d-x\n-keep public class org.cocos2dx.** { *; }\n-dontwarn org.cocos2dx.**\n-keep public class com.chukong.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.chukong.**\n\n# google play service\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.** { public *; }\n-dontwarn com.google.android.gms.**\n\n-keep class * extends java.util.ListResourceBundle {\n    protected Object[][] getContents();\n}\n\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.common.internal.safeparcel.SafeParcelable {\n    public static final *** NULL;\n}\n\n-keepnames @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName class *\n-keepclassmembernames class * {\n    @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName *;\n}\n\n-keepnames class * implements android.os.Parcelable {\n    public static final ** CREATOR;\n}\n\n#sdkbox\n-keep class com.sdkbox.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.sdkbox.**\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Proguard only works with \nRelease\n builds (i.e \ncocos run -m release\n) debug builds do not invoke Proguard rules.",

            "text": "Initialize Facebook  Modify your Lua code to  init()  the plugin. This can be done anyplace, however it must be done before trying to use the plugin's features.  sdkbox.PluginFacebook:init();  Using Facebook  Login  First the user needs to login to Facebook in order to use it.  sdkbox.PluginFacebook:login();  If a user doesn't want to use Facebook functionality anymore, logout. using  sdkbox.PluginFacebook:logout();  You can check whether user already logged in using  sdkbox.PluginFacebook:isLoggedIn();   Note: user only needs to perform login once, unless they logout   Permissions  Facebook requires you to ask for the user's permission before you can perform actions, such as, posting on the user's behalf.\nThere are two types of permission  read  and  publish \nYou can get a complete list of permissions  here  SDKBOX provides the most commonly used permissions:   FB_PERM_READ_PUBLIC_PROFILE  FB_PERM_READ_EMAIL  FB_PERM_READ_USER_FRIENDS  FB_PERM_PUBLISH_POST   To request a permission, you do so by specifying what you want:  sdkbox.PluginFacebook:requestReadPermissions({FB_PERM_READ_PUBLIC_PROFILE, FB_PERM_READ_USER_FRIENDS});\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:requestPublishPermissions({FB_PERM_PUBLISH_POST});  Share  There are two types of sharing functionality.   share  will automatically post to the user's wall\nshare a link:   local info;\ninfo.type  =  link ;\ninfo.link  =  http://www.cocos2d-x.org ;\ninfo.title =  cocos2d-x ;\ninfo.text  =  Best Game Engine ;\ninfo.image =  http://cocos2d-x.org/images/logo.png ;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:share(info);  share a photo:  local info;\ninfo.type  =  photo ;\ninfo.title =  My Photo ;\ninfo.image = __path to image__;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:share(info);   dialog  will show a dialog and prompt the user to write their own comments in addition:   present a share dialog:  local info;\ninfo.type  =  link ;\ninfo.link  =  http://www.cocos2d-x.org ;\ninfo.title =  cocos2d-x ;\ninfo.text  =  Best Game Engine ;\ninfo.image =  http://cocos2d-x.org/images/logo.png ;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:dialog(info);  share a photo with comments:  local info;\ninfo.type  =  photo ;\ninfo.title =  My Photo ;\ninfo.image = __path to image__;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:dialog(info);   Note: sharing photo with comments requires the  Facebook app  to be installed on the device.   Invite  There are both  standard  and  custom   Invite  dialogs available to use when inviting your Friends.  When using the  standard invite dialog , it is necessary to select the friends to send the invitation request too. The API call is  inviteFriends()  passing in a URL for  app  and a  preview image . Example:  sdkbox.PluginFacebook:inviteFriends(\n  https://fb.me/322164761287181 ,\n  http://www.cocos2d-x.org/attachments/801/cocos2dx_portrait.png );   Note: Contrary to what it may seem the  app link url , it is not an App Store or Google Play application url. You must follow the instructions on this  page   and use the resulting url as the  app_link_url  parameter. Facebook hosts this file for the developer, but anyone could host their own file using this  format   Creating a  custom invite dialog  is a two step process, starting with a call to  requestInvitableFriends()  then a call to  inviteFriendsWithInviteIds()  to actually send the invites. Example:  sdkbox.PluginFacebook:inviteFriendsWithInviteIds({}, \u201ctitle , \u201cinvitation text );  The  requestInvitableFriends()  function has a  Bundle(map )  parameter, where the developer can define a few flags:     Flag  Description      fields  a comma separated values of the fields you want to get from your invitable friend\u2019s profiles.    exclude_ids  a comma separated FB ids to exclude from the result.    limit  number of friends per page.     A call to  requestInvitableFriends()  will return a different collection of friends per call, and it is Facebook's decision which ones to return first.\nThis function returns a  FBInvitableFriendsInfo  object, which will contain a collection of the friends data and a pagination cursor object which has URLS for requesting the next and previous page of invitable friends.  The  custom invite dialog  is only available for games with a  canvas implementation  for the Facebook application. The  canvas  must be defined but doesn't need to how any web content. If the  canvas  is not defined a  standard invite dialog  is used instead.  Graph API  You can perform  Graph API  using  api  function  For example, to get the friend list:  local params;\nsdkbox.PluginFacebook:api( /me/friendlists ,  GET , params,  /me/friendlists );  Facebook events  This allows you to catch  Facebook  events so that you can perform operations after Facebook events have occurred.  sdkbox.PluginFacebook:setListener(function(args)\n    if  onLogin  == args.name then\n        local isLogin = args.isLogin;\n        local msg = args.msg;\n    elseif  onPermission  ==  args.name then\n        local isLogin = args.isLogin;\n        local msg = args.msg;\n    elseif  onAPI  ==  args.name then\n        local tag = args.tag;\n        local jsonData = args.jsonData;\n    elseif  onSharedSuccess  ==  args.name then\n        local msg = args.message\n    elseif  onSharedFailed  ==  args.name then\n        local msg = args.message\n    elseif  onSharedCancel  ==  args.name then\n    end\nend)",

We recommend to do this in the \nAppDelegate::applicationDidFinishLaunching()\n or \nAppController:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions()\n. Make sure to include the appropriate headers. \ninit()\n and \nstartSession()\n are required. Example:\n\n\n#include \nPluginFlurryAnalytics/PluginFlurryAnalytics.h\n\nAppDelegate::applicationDidFinishLaunching()\n{\n     sdkbox::PluginFlurryAnalytics::init();\n     // start session\n     sdkbox::PluginFlurryAnalytics::startSession();\n}\n\n\n\n\nUsing Flurry Analytics\n\n\nAfter initialization you can begin to use the Flurry Analytics functionality.

If \nApplication.mk\n contains \nAPP_STL := c++_static\n, it should be\nchanged to:\n\n\nAPP_STL := gnustl_static\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using cocos2d-x from source, assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/\nlib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using the prebuilt cocos2d-x libraries assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n./src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n When using Cocos2d-x from source, different versions have \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n in a different location. One way to find the location is to look in \nproj.android/project.properties\n. Example:\n  \nandroid.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java\n\n\nIn this case, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n should be located at:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to add the following imports:\n\n\n\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, modify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to edit the \nonCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)\n function to add a call to \nSDKBox.init(this);\n. The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to \nonLoadNativeLibraries();\n. Example:\n\n\n\n\nonLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code. There are a few rules here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has not been defined, \nadd it\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has been defined, add the calls to \nSDKBox\n in the \nsame\n existing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nProguard (optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file.

You may need to add the required entry to the \ninfo.plist\n, under \nLSApplicationQueriesSchemes\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON Configuration\n\n\nSDKBOX Installer will automatically inject a sample configuration to your \nsdkbox_config.json\n, that you have to modify it before you can use it for your own app\n\n\nHere is an example of the Google Analytics configuration, you need to replace \nAPI KEY\n  with your specific \nFlurry Analytics ID\n account information.\nHere is an example adding \nFlurryAnalytics\n to iOS:\n\n\nFlurryAnalytics\n:{\n            \nAPIKey\n:\nAPI KEY\n,\n            \nAppVersion\n:\nV0.1\n,\n            \nDebug\n:false,\n            \nLevel\n:2,\n            \nSessionTimeout\n:10,\n            \nCrashReport\n:true\n}\n\n\n\n\nAdding \nFlurryAnalytics\n to Android is a bit different as it supports \nlocations\n, \npulse\n and \norigin\n settings. Here is an example adding \nFlurryAnalytics\n to Android:\n\n\nFlurryAnalytics\n:{\n            \nAPIKey\n:\nAPI KEY\n,\n            \nAppVersion\n:\nV0.1\n,\n            \nDebug\n:false,\n            \nLogEvent\n:true,\n            \nLevel\n:2,\n            \nSessionTimeout\n:10,\n            \nCrashReport\n:true,\n            \nLocationReport\n:true,\n            \nDefLocationLat\n:104.06,\n            \nDefLocationLon\n:30.67,\n            \nPulse\n:true,\n            \nOrigin\n:[\n                {\n                    \nOriginName\n:\nsdkbox\n,\n                    \nOriginVersion\n:\nv0.1\n,\n                    \nOriginParams\n:{\n                        \nKey1\n:\nVal1\n,\n                        \nKey2\n:\nVal2\n,\n                        \nKey3\n:\nVal3\n\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    \nOriginName\n:\nsdkbox\n,\n                    \nOriginVersion\n:\nv0.1\n\n                }\n            ]\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nRegister Javascript Functions\n\n\nYou need to register all the Flurry Analytics JS functions with cocos2d-x before using them.\n\n\nTo do this:\n* Modify \n./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp\n to include the following headers:\n\n\n#include \nPluginFlurryAnalyticsJS.hpp\n\n#include \nPluginFlurryAnalyticsJSHelper.h\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \n./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp\n make sure to call:\n\n\n\n\nsc-\naddRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginFlurryAnalyticsJS);\nsc-\naddRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginFlurryAnalyticsJS_helper);\n\n\n\n\nInitialize Flurry Analytics\n\n\nInitialize the plugin by calling \ninit()\n where appropriate in your code. We\nrecommend to do this in the \napp.js\n. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFlurryAnalytics.init();\n\n\n\n\nUsing Flurry Analytics\n\n\nAfter initialization you can begin to use the Flurry Analytics functionality. Use \nlogevent\n where ever you want from your code:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFlurryAnalytics.logEvent(\ntest event2 js\n, JSON.stringify({\neKey1\n:\neVal1\n, \neKey2\n:\neVal2\n}));\n\n\n\n\nCatch Flurry Analytics events (optional)\n\n\nThis allows you to catch the \nFlurryAnalytics\n events so that you can perform operations based upon responses.

If \nApplication.mk\n contains \nAPP_STL := c++_static\n, it should be\nchanged to:\n\n\nAPP_STL := gnustl_static\n\n\n\n\nCopy all source and header files from \nplugin/jsbindings/\n to your projects \nClasses\n folder.\n\n\nAdd all \n.cpp\n files, that you just copied, to \nAndroid.mk\n in the \nLOCAL_SRC_FILES\n section. Example\n\n\nLOCAL_SRC_FILES := hellocpp/main.cpp \\\n                  ../../Classes/AppDelegate.cpp \\\n                  ../../Classes/HelloWorldScene.cpp \\\n                                    ../../Classes/NewSourceFile.cpp\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using cocos2d-x from source, assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/\nlib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using the prebuilt cocos2d-x libraries assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n./src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n When using Cocos2d-x from source, different versions have \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n in a different location. One way to find the location is to look in \nproj.android/project.properties\n. Example:\n  \nandroid.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java\n\n\nIn this case, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n should be located at:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to add the following imports:\n\n\n\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, modify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to edit the \nonCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)\n function to add a call to \nSDKBox.init(this);\n. The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to \nonLoadNativeLibraries();\n. Example:\n\n\n\n\nonLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code. There are a few rules here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has not been defined, \nadd it\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has been defined, add the calls to \nSDKBox\n in the \nsame\n existing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nProguard (optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file.

A simple example might look like this:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFlurryAnalytics:init()\nsdkbox.PluginFlurryAnalytics:setListener(function(data)\n        local ret = json.decode(data)\n        print(\napiKey:\n, ret.apiKey, \nsessionId:\n, ret.sessionId)\n        -- check session state\n        print(\nFlurry analytics session exist: \n, f:activeSessionExists())\n        print(\nFlurry analytics session: \n, f:getSessionID())\n        local eventName = \ntest event1\n\n        sdkbox.PluginFlurryAnalytics:logEvent(eventName)\n    end)\nsdkbox.PluginFlurryAnalytics:startSession()\n\n\n\n\nEnding Flurry Analytics (Android only)\n\n\nWhen you are finished using \nFlurryAnalytics\n or when your games ends. It is necessary to end the \nFlurryAnalytics\n session. This is a requirement for Android but optional on iOS.

If \nApplication.mk\n contains \nAPP_STL := c++_static\n, it should be\nchanged to:\n\n\nAPP_STL := gnustl_static\n\n\n\n\nCopy all source and header files from \nplugin/luabindings/\n to your projects \nClasses\n folder.\n\n\nAdd all \n.cpp\n files, that you just copied, to \nAndroid.mk\n in the \nLOCAL_SRC_FILES\n section. Example\n\n\nLOCAL_SRC_FILES := hellocpp/main.cpp \\\n                ../../Classes/AppDelegate.cpp \\\n                ../../Classes/HelloWorldScene.cpp \\\n                                ../../Classes/NewSourceFile.cpp\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using cocos2d-x from source, assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/\nlib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using the prebuilt cocos2d-x libraries assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n./src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n When using Cocos2d-x from source, different versions have \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n in a different location. One way to find the location is to look in \nproj.android/project.properties\n. Example:\n  \nandroid.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java\n\n\nIn this case, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n should be located at:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to add the following imports:\n\n\n\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, modify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to edit the \nonCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)\n function to add a call to \nSDKBox.init(this);\n. The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to \nonLoadNativeLibraries();\n. Example:\n\n\n\n\nonLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code. There are a few rules here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has not been defined, \nadd it\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has been defined, add the calls to \nSDKBox\n in the \nsame\n existing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nProguard (optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file.

One way to find the location is to look in  proj.android/project.properties . Example:\n   android.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java  In this case,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  should be located at:  ../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java   Modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to add the following imports:   import android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;   Second, modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to edit the  onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)  function to add a call to  SDKBox.init(this); . The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to  onLoadNativeLibraries(); . Example:   onLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);    Last, we need to insert the proper  overrides  code. There are a few rules here.    If the method listed has not been defined,  add it .

You may need to add the required entry to the \ninfo.plist\n, under \nLSApplicationQueriesSchemes\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON Configuration\n\n\nSDKBOX Installer will automatically inject a sample configuration to your \nsdkbox_config.json\n, that you have to modify it before you can use it for your own app\n\n\nHere is an example of the Google Analytics configuration, you need to replace \nAPI KEY\n  with your specific \nFlurry Analytics ID\n account information.\nHere is an example adding \nFlurryAnalytics\n to iOS:\n\n\nFlurryAnalytics\n:{\n            \nAPIKey\n:\nAPI KEY\n,\n            \nAppVersion\n:\nV0.1\n,\n            \nDebug\n:false,\n            \nLevel\n:2,\n            \nSessionTimeout\n:10,\n            \nCrashReport\n:true\n}\n\n\n\n\nAdding \nFlurryAnalytics\n to Android is a bit different as it supports \nlocations\n, \npulse\n and \norigin\n settings. Here is an example adding \nFlurryAnalytics\n to Android:\n\n\nFlurryAnalytics\n:{\n            \nAPIKey\n:\nAPI KEY\n,\n            \nAppVersion\n:\nV0.1\n,\n            \nDebug\n:false,\n            \nLogEvent\n:true,\n            \nLevel\n:2,\n            \nSessionTimeout\n:10,\n            \nCrashReport\n:true,\n            \nLocationReport\n:true,\n            \nDefLocationLat\n:104.06,\n            \nDefLocationLon\n:30.67,\n            \nPulse\n:true,\n            \nOrigin\n:[\n                {\n                    \nOriginName\n:\nsdkbox\n,\n                    \nOriginVersion\n:\nv0.1\n,\n                    \nOriginParams\n:{\n                        \nKey1\n:\nVal1\n,\n                        \nKey2\n:\nVal2\n,\n                        \nKey3\n:\nVal3\n\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    \nOriginName\n:\nsdkbox\n,\n                    \nOriginVersion\n:\nv0.1\n\n                }\n            ]\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nInitialize Flurry Analytics\n\n\nInitialize the plugin where appropriate in your code. We recommend to do this in the \nAppDelegate::applicationDidFinishLaunching()\n or \nAppController:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions()\n. Make sure to include the appropriate headers. \ninit()\n and \nstartSession()\n are required. Example:\n\n\n#include \nPluginFlurryAnalytics/PluginFlurryAnalytics.h\n\nAppDelegate::applicationDidFinishLaunching()\n{\n     sdkbox::PluginFlurryAnalytics::init();\n     // start session\n     sdkbox::PluginFlurryAnalytics::startSession();\n}\n\n\n\n\nUsing Flurry Analytics\n\n\nAfter initialization you can begin to use the Flurry Analytics functionality.

Here is an example adding \nFlurryAnalytics\n to Android:\n\n\nFlurryAnalytics\n:{\n            \nAPIKey\n:\nAPI KEY\n,\n            \nAppVersion\n:\nV0.1\n,\n            \nDebug\n:false,\n            \nLogEvent\n:true,\n            \nLevel\n:2,\n            \nSessionTimeout\n:10,\n            \nCrashReport\n:true,\n            \nLocationReport\n:true,\n            \nDefLocationLat\n:104.06,\n            \nDefLocationLon\n:30.67,\n            \nPulse\n:true,\n            \nOrigin\n:[\n                {\n                    \nOriginName\n:\nsdkbox\n,\n                    \nOriginVersion\n:\nv0.1\n,\n                    \nOriginParams\n:{\n                        \nKey1\n:\nVal1\n,\n                        \nKey2\n:\nVal2\n,\n                        \nKey3\n:\nVal3\n\n                    }\n                },\n                {\n                    \nOriginName\n:\nsdkbox\n,\n                    \nOriginVersion\n:\nv0.1\n\n                }\n            ]\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nRegister Javascript Functions\n\n\nYou need to register all the Flurry Analytics JS functions with cocos2d-x before using them.\n\n\nTo do this:\n* Modify \n./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp\n to include the following headers:\n\n\n#include \nPluginFlurryAnalyticsJS.hpp\n\n#include \nPluginFlurryAnalyticsJSHelper.h\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \n./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp\n make sure to call:\n\n\n\n\nsc-\naddRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginFlurryAnalyticsJS);\nsc-\naddRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginFlurryAnalyticsJS_helper);\n\n\n\n\nInitialize Flurry Analytics\n\n\nInitialize the plugin by calling \ninit()\n where appropriate in your code. We\nrecommend to do this in the \napp.js\n. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFlurryAnalytics.init();\n\n\n\n\nUsing Flurry Analytics\n\n\nAfter initialization you can begin to use the Flurry Analytics functionality. Use \nlogevent\n where ever you want from your code:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFlurryAnalytics.logEvent(\ntest event2 js\n, JSON.stringify({\neKey1\n:\neVal1\n, \neKey2\n:\neVal2\n}));\n\n\n\n\nCatch Flurry Analytics events (optional)\n\n\nThis allows you to catch the \nFlurryAnalytics\n events so that you can perform operations based upon responses. A simple example might look like this:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginFlurryAnalytics.init();\nsdkbox.PluginFlurryAnalytics.setListener({\n    flurrySessionDidCreateWithInfo:function(info) {\n        var jsonInfo = JSON.parse(info)\n        console.log(\nsession started\n)\n        console.log(\nAPIKey :\n + jsonInfo.apiKey + \n session id :\n + jsonInfo.sessionId);\n        sdkbox.PluginFlurryAnalytics.logEvent(\ntest event2 js\n, JSON.stringify({\neKey1\n:\neVal1\n, \neKey2\n:\neVal2\n}));\n    }\n});\nsdkbox.PluginFlurryAnalytics.startSession();\n\n\n\n\nEnding Flurry Analytics (Android only)\n\n\nWhen you are finished using \nFlurryAnalytics\n or when your games ends.

To do this:\n* Modify  ./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp  to include the following headers:  #include  PluginFlurryAnalyticsJS.hpp \n#include  PluginFlurryAnalyticsJSHelper.h    Modify  ./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp  make sure to call:   sc- addRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginFlurryAnalyticsJS);\nsc- addRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginFlurryAnalyticsJS_helper);  Initialize Flurry Analytics  Initialize the plugin by calling  init()  where appropriate in your code. We\nrecommend to do this in the  app.js . Example:  sdkbox.PluginFlurryAnalytics.init();  Using Flurry Analytics  After initialization you can begin to use the Flurry Analytics functionality. Use  logevent  where ever you want from your code:  sdkbox.PluginFlurryAnalytics.logEvent( test event2 js , JSON.stringify({ eKey1 : eVal1 ,  eKey2 : eVal2 }));  Catch Flurry Analytics events (optional)  This allows you to catch the  FlurryAnalytics  events so that you can perform operations based upon responses.

You may need to add the required entry to the \ninfo.plist\n, under \nLSApplicationQueriesSchemes\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON Configuration\n\n\nSDKBOX Installer will automatically inject a sample configuration to your \nres/sdkbox_config.json\n, that you have to modify it before you can use it for your own app\n\n\nHere is an example of the Google Analytics configuration, you need to replace \nTRACKING_CODE\n  with your specific \nGoogle Analytics Tracking Code\n account information.\n\n\nGoogleAnalytics\n : {\n    \ntrackingCode\n : \nTRACKING_CODE\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nTracker\n\n\nA \ntracker\n is used to aggregate the tracked events. There are some considerations that the developer must review:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou must create a mobile tracker or reuse a previously created one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the tracker is new, it will take up to 24 hours to show tracking data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you see some historical activity on the tracker, you can see realtime data as well, not before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can create as many trackers as you wish, but the plugin configuration only allows to define one (the base use case).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf no tracker is set in the configuration, there will be no tracking session. This means that at a later time, a new (or more) tracker can be created. In this case, a explicit call to \nstartSession()\n should be performed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether the tracker is set in the plugin configuration or manually created, all tracking events will be sent to the server automatically. The implementation buffers tracking events and sends them to the server it batches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nInitialize Google Analytics\n\n\nInitialize the plugin where appropriate in your code. We recommend to do this in the \nAppDelegate::applicationDidFinishLaunching()\n or \nAppController:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions()\n. Make sure to include the appropriate headers:\n\n\n#include \nPluginGoogleAnalytics/PluginGoogleAnalytics.h\n\nAppDelegate::applicationDidFinishLaunching()\n{\n     sdkbox::PluginGoogleAnalytics::init();\n}\n\n\n\n\nYou can always manually stop recording events at any time by calling:\n\n\nsdkbox::PluginGoogleAnalytics::stopSession();\n\n\n\n\nHowever, in-order to record events again you must then manually call:\n\n\nsdkbox::PluginGoogleAnalytics::startSession();\n\n\n\n\nLogged data usually shows up within one day.\n\n\nAPI Reference\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nstatic void init ( ) ;\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitialize the plugin instance.\n\n\n\n\nstatic void startSession ( ) ;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analytics session is being explicitly started at plugin initialization time.\n\n\n\n\nstatic void stopSession ( ) ;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou normally will never stop a session manually.\n\n\n\n\nstatic void dispatchHits ( ) ;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManually request dispatch of hits.

It is not necessary.\n\n\nThese steps are listed last in this document on purpose as they are seldom needed. If you find yourself using these steps, please, after completing, double back and re-read the steps above for other integration items.\n\n\nManual Integration For iOS\n\n\nDrag and drop the following frameworks from the \nplugins/ios\n folder of\nthe\nGoogleAnalytics\n bundle into your Xcode project, check \nCopy items if needed\n when adding frameworks:\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.framework\n\n\nPluginGoogleAnalytics.framework\n\n\n\n\nThe above frameworks depend upon other frameworks. You also need to add the\nfollowing system frameworks, if you don't already have them:\n\n\n\n\nCoreData.framework\n\n\nSecurity.framework\n\n\nSystemConfiguration.framework\n\n\nlibz.dylib\n\n\nlibsqlite3.dylib\n\n\nlibAdIdAccess.a\n\n\nAdSupport.framework\n\n\n\n\nAdd a linker flag, if your setup requires it, to:\n\nTarget -\n Build Settings -\n Linking -\n Other Linker Flags\n:\n\n\n\n\n-force_load /path/to/libAdIdAccess.a\n\n\n\n\nManual Integration For Android\n\n\nSDKBOX supports three different kinds of \nAndroid\n projects \ncommand-line\n, \neclipse\n and \nAndroid Studio\n. \n\n\n\n\nproj.android\n will be used as our \nproject_root\n for \ncommand-line\n and \neclipse\n project\n\n\nproj.android-studio\n will be used as our \nproject_root\n for \nAndroid Studio\n project.\n\n\n\n\nCopy Files\n\n\nCopy the following \njar\n files from \nplugin/android/libs\n folder of this\nbundle into your project\u2019s \n/libs\n folder.\n\n\n\n\nPluginGoogleAnalytics.jar\n\n\nsdkbox.jar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using cocos2d-x from source copy the \njar\n files to:\n\n\nAndroid command-line:\n\ncocos2d/cocos/platform/android/java/libs\n\n\nAndroid Studio:\n\ncocos2d/cocos/platform/android/libcocos2dx/libs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using cocos2d-js or lua copy the \njar\n files to:\n\n\nAndroid command-line:\n\nframeworks/cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/libs\n\n\nAndroid Studio:\n\nframeworks/cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/libcocos2dx/libs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using prebuilt cocos2d-x copy the \njar\n files to:\n\n\nAndroid command-line:\n\nproject_root\n/libs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy jni libs\n\n\nCopy and overwrite all the folders from \nplugin/android/jni\n\nto your \nproject_root\n/jni/\n directory.\n\n\n\n\nNote: sdkbox link with \ngnustl\n by default, if your project link with \nc++static\n please replace the files in \nproject_root\n/jni/\nplugin_name\n/libs\n with files in \nproject_root\n/jni/\nplugin_name\n/libs_c++_static\n folder\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nAndroidManifest.xml\n\n\nInclude the following permissions above the \napplication tag\n:\n\n\n  \nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.INTERNET\n /\n\n  \nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\n /\n\n  \nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.WAKE_LOCK\n /\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are also a few necessary meta-data tags that also need to be added:\n\n\nmeta-data android:name=\ncom.google.android.gms.version\n\n    android:value=\n@integer/google_play_services_version\n /\n\n\nmeta-data\n    android:name=\ncom.google.android.gms.analytics.globalConfigResource\n\n    android:resource=\n@xml/global_tracker\n /\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, register the \nAnalyticsReceiver\n:\n\n\nreceiver android:name=\ncom.google.android.gms.analytics.AnalyticsReceiver\n\n    android:enabled=\ntrue\n\n    \nintent-filter\n\n        \naction android:name=\ncom.google.android.gms.analytics.ANALYTICS_DISPATCH\n /\n\n    \n/intent-filter\n\n\n/receiver\n\n\nservice android:name=\ncom.google.android.gms.analytics.AnalyticsService\n\n    android:enabled=\ntrue\n\n    android:exported=\nfalse\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to use optional \nReceivers\n, specify them next:\n\n\n!-- Optionally, register CampaignTrackingReceiver and CampaignTrackingService to enable installation campaign reporting --\n\n\nreceiver android:name=\ncom.google.android.gms.analytics.CampaignTrackingReceiver\n\n    android:exported=\ntrue\n\n    \nintent-filter\n\n        \naction android:name=\ncom.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER\n /\n\n    \n/intent-filter\n\n\n/receiver\n\n\nservice android:name=\ncom.google.android.gms.analytics.CampaignTrackingService\n /\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the meta-data files\n\n\nIn the step above a file named \nglobal_tracker.xml\n was specified. This file needs to be created and populated with a few required settings. So where does it go? Take a look again at the code tag from above:\n\n\nmeta-data\n    android:name=\ncom.google.android.gms.analytics.globalConfigResource\n\n    android:resource=\n@xml/global_tracker\n /\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice the \nandroid:resource=\n attribute. This gives you the path of where to create this file, in this case it would be \nproject_root\n/res/xml\n.\n\n\nThis file needs to contain required settings. The contents of this file could be something like this:\n\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n encoding=\nutf-8\n?\n\n\nresources\n\n    \ninteger name=\nga_dispatchPeriod\n300\n/integer\n\n    \nstring name=\nga_logLevel\nverbose\n/string\n\n\n/resources\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nAndroid.mk\n\n\nEdit \nproject_root\n/jni/Android.mk\n to:\n\n\nAdd additional requirements to \nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES\n:\n\n\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += PluginGoogleAnalytics\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += sdkbox\n\n\n\n\nAdd a call to:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n\n\n\n\nbefore any \nimport-module\n statements.\n\n\nAdd additional \nimport-module\n statements at the end:\n\n\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./plugingoogleanalytics)\n\n\n\n\nThis means that your ordering should look similar to this:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./plugingoogleanalytics)\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n It is important to make sure these statements are above the existing \n$(call import-module,./prebuilt-mk)\n statement, if you are using the pre-built libraries.\n\n\nModify \nApplication.mk\n (Cocos2d-x v3.0 to v3.2 only)\n\n\nEdit \nproject_root\n/jni/Application.mk\n to make sure \nAPP_STL\n is defined\ncorrectly. If \nApplication.mk\n contains \nAPP_STL := c++_static\n, it should be\nchanged to:\n\n\nAPP_STL := gnustl_static\n\n\n\n\nModify \nproject.properties\n\n\nAn \nAndroid Library Reference\n for \nGoogle Play Services\n is required. The\npath will be different depending upon your setup. Also, this is an additional\ndownload that does not come as part of a standard install. To install use the\n\nsdk installer\n and choose \nextras-\ngoogle play services\n. Here is an example of what this line could look like:\n\n\nandroid.library.reference.1=\n../android/sdk.latest/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject/\ngoogle-play-services_lib\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n if you already have an \nandroid.library.reference.1\n you can add\nanother by incrementing the number as \nandroid.library.reference.2\n, etc.\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using cocos2d-x from source, assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/\nlib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using the prebuilt cocos2d-x libraries assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n./src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n When using Cocos2d-x from source, different versions have \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n in a different location. One way to find the location is to look in \nproj.android/project.properties\n. Example:\n  \nandroid.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java\n\n\nIn this case, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n should be located at:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to add the following imports:\n\n\n\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, modify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to edit the \nonCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)\n function to add a call to \nSDKBox.init(this);\n. The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to \nonLoadNativeLibraries();\n.

This gives you the path of where to create this file, in this case it would be  project_root /res/xml .  This file needs to contain required settings. The contents of this file could be something like this:  ?xml version= 1.0  encoding= utf-8 ?  resources \n     integer name= ga_dispatchPeriod 300 /integer \n     string name= ga_logLevel verbose /string  /resources   Edit  Android.mk  Edit  project_root /jni/Android.mk  to:  Add additional requirements to  LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES :  LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += PluginGoogleAnalytics\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += sdkbox  Add a call to:  $(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))  before any  import-module  statements.  Add additional  import-module  statements at the end:  $(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./plugingoogleanalytics)  This means that your ordering should look similar to this:  $(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./plugingoogleanalytics)  Note:  It is important to make sure these statements are above the existing  $(call import-module,./prebuilt-mk)  statement, if you are using the pre-built libraries.  Modify  Application.mk  (Cocos2d-x v3.0 to v3.2 only)  Edit  project_root /jni/Application.mk  to make sure  APP_STL  is defined\ncorrectly. If  Application.mk  contains  APP_STL := c++_static , it should be\nchanged to:  APP_STL := gnustl_static  Modify  project.properties  An  Android Library Reference  for  Google Play Services  is required. The\npath will be different depending upon your setup. Also, this is an additional\ndownload that does not come as part of a standard install. To install use the sdk installer  and choose  extras- google play services . Here is an example of what this line could look like:  android.library.reference.1=\n../android/sdk.latest/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject/\ngoogle-play-services_lib  Note:  if you already have an  android.library.reference.1  you can add\nanother by incrementing the number as  android.library.reference.2 , etc.  Modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java    If you're using cocos2d-x from source, assuming you are in the  proj.android  directory,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  is located:  ../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/\nlib/Cocos2dxActivity.java    If you're using the prebuilt cocos2d-x libraries assuming you are in the  proj.android  directory,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  is located:  ./src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java    Note:  When using Cocos2d-x from source, different versions have  Cocos2dxActivity.java  in a different location. One way to find the location is to look in  proj.android/project.properties . Example:\n   android.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java  In this case,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  should be located at:  ../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java   Modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to add the following imports:   import android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;   Second, modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to edit the  onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)  function to add a call to  SDKBox.init(this); . The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to  onLoadNativeLibraries(); . Example:   onLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);    Last, we need to insert the proper  overrides  code. There are a few rules here.    If the method listed has not been defined,  add it .

Take a look again at the code tag from above:\n\n\nmeta-data\n    android:name=\ncom.google.android.gms.analytics.globalConfigResource\n\n    android:resource=\n@xml/global_tracker\n /\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice the \nandroid:resource=\n attribute. This gives you the path of where to create this file, in this case it would be \nproject_root\n/res/xml\n.\n\n\nThis file needs to contain required settings. The contents of this file could be something like this:\n\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n encoding=\nutf-8\n?\n\n\nresources\n\n    \ninteger name=\nga_dispatchPeriod\n300\n/integer\n\n    \nstring name=\nga_logLevel\nverbose\n/string\n\n\n/resources\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nAndroid.mk\n\n\nEdit \nproject_root\n/jni/Android.mk\n to:\n\n\nAdd additional requirements to \nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES\n:\n\n\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += PluginGoogleAnalytics\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += sdkbox\n\n\n\n\nAdd a call to:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n\n\n\n\nbefore any \nimport-module\n statements.\n\n\nAdd additional \nimport-module\n statements at the end:\n\n\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./plugingoogleanalytics)\n\n\n\n\nThis means that your ordering should look similar to this:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./plugingoogleanalytics)\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n It is important to make sure these statements are above the existing \n$(call import-module,./prebuilt-mk)\n statement, if you are using the pre-built libraries.\n\n\nModify \nApplication.mk\n (Cocos2d-x v3.0 to v3.2 only)\n\n\nEdit \nproject_root\n/jni/Application.mk\n to make sure \nAPP_STL\n is defined\ncorrectly. If \nApplication.mk\n contains \nAPP_STL := c++_static\n, it should be\nchanged to:\n\n\nAPP_STL := gnustl_static\n\n\n\n\nCopy all source and header files from \nplugin/jsbindings/\n to your projects \nClasses\n folder.\n\n\nAdd all \n.cpp\n files, that you just copied, to \nAndroid.mk\n in the \nLOCAL_SRC_FILES\n section. Example\n\n\nLOCAL_SRC_FILES := hellocpp/main.cpp \\\n                  ../../Classes/AppDelegate.cpp \\\n                  ../../Classes/HelloWorldScene.cpp \\\n                                    ../../Classes/NewSourceFile.cpp\n\n\n\n\nModify \nproject.properties\n\n\nAn \nAndroid Library Reference\n for \nGoogle Play Services\n is required. The\npath will be different depending upon your setup. Also, this is an additional\ndownload that does not come as part of a standard install. To install use the\n\nsdk installer\n and choose \nextras-\ngoogle play services\n. Here is an example of what this line could look like:\n\n\nandroid.library.reference.1=\n../android/sdk.latest/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject/\ngoogle-play-services_lib\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n if you already have an \nandroid.library.reference.1\n you can add\nanother by incrementing the number as \nandroid.library.reference.2\n, etc.\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using cocos2d-x from source, assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/\nlib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using the prebuilt cocos2d-x libraries assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n./src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n When using Cocos2d-x from source, different versions have \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n in a different location. One way to find the location is to look in \nproj.android/project.properties\n. Example:\n  \nandroid.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java\n\n\nIn this case, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n should be located at:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to add the following imports:\n\n\n\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, modify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to edit the \nonCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)\n function to add a call to \nSDKBox.init(this);\n. The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to \nonLoadNativeLibraries();\n. Example:\n\n\n\n\nonLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code. There are a few rules here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has not been defined, \nadd it\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has been defined, add the calls to \nSDKBox\n in the \nsame\n existing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nProguard (optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file. Example:\n\n\n\n\nproguard.config=${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt:proguard-project.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the file you specified to include the following:\n\n\n\n\n# cocos2d-x\n-keep public class org.cocos2dx.** { *; }\n-dontwarn org.cocos2dx.**\n-keep public class com.chukong.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.chukong.**\n\n# google play service\n-keep class com.google.android.gms.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.google.android.gms.**\n\n-keep class * extends java.util.ListResourceBundle {\n    protected Object[][] getContents();\n}\n\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.common.internal.safeparcel.SafeParcelable {\n    public static final *** NULL;\n}\n\n-keepnames @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName class *\n-keepclassmembernames class * {\n    @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName *;\n}\n\n-keepnames class * implements android.os.Parcelable {\n    public static final ** CREATOR;\n}\n\n#sdkbox\n-keep class com.sdkbox.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.sdkbox.**\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Proguard only works with \nRelease\n builds (i.e \ncocos run -m release\n) debug builds do not invoke Proguard rules.",

You can create as many trackers as you wish, but the plugin configuration only allows to define one (the base use case).    If no tracker is set in the configuration, there will be no tracking session. This means that at a later time, a new (or more) tracker can be created.

This gives you the path of where to create this file, in this case it would be  project_root /res/xml .  This file needs to contain required settings. The contents of this file could be something like this:  ?xml version= 1.0  encoding= utf-8 ?  resources \n     integer name= ga_dispatchPeriod 300 /integer \n     string name= ga_logLevel verbose /string  /resources   Edit  Android.mk  Edit  project_root /jni/Android.mk  to:  Add additional requirements to  LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES :  LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += PluginGoogleAnalytics\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += sdkbox  Add a call to:  $(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))  before any  import-module  statements.  Add additional  import-module  statements at the end:  $(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./plugingoogleanalytics)  This means that your ordering should look similar to this:  $(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./plugingoogleanalytics)  Note:  It is important to make sure these statements are above the existing  $(call import-module,./prebuilt-mk)  statement, if you are using the pre-built libraries.  Modify  Application.mk  (Cocos2d-x v3.0 to v3.2 only)  Edit  project_root /jni/Application.mk  to make sure  APP_STL  is defined\ncorrectly. If  Application.mk  contains  APP_STL := c++_static , it should be\nchanged to:  APP_STL := gnustl_static  Copy all source and header files from  plugin/jsbindings/  to your projects  Classes  folder.

The\npath will be different depending upon your setup. Also, this is an additional\ndownload that does not come as part of a standard install. To install use the sdk installer  and choose  extras- google play services . Here is an example of what this line could look like:  android.library.reference.1=\n../android/sdk.latest/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject/\ngoogle-play-services_lib  Note:  if you already have an  android.library.reference.1  you can add\nanother by incrementing the number as  android.library.reference.2 , etc.  Modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java    If you're using cocos2d-x from source, assuming you are in the  proj.android  directory,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  is located:  ../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/\nlib/Cocos2dxActivity.java    If you're using the prebuilt cocos2d-x libraries assuming you are in the  proj.android  directory,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  is located:  ./src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java    Note:  When using Cocos2d-x from source, different versions have  Cocos2dxActivity.java  in a different location. One way to find the location is to look in  proj.android/project.properties . Example:\n   android.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java  In this case,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  should be located at:  ../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java   Modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to add the following imports:   import android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;   Second, modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to edit the  onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)  function to add a call to  SDKBox.init(this); . The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to  onLoadNativeLibraries(); . Example:   onLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);    Last, we need to insert the proper  overrides  code. There are a few rules here.    If the method listed has not been defined,  add it .    If the method listed has been defined, add the calls to  SDKBox  in the  same  existing function.          @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }",

There are some considerations that the developer must review:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou must create a mobile tracker or reuse a previously created one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the tracker is new, it will take up to 24 hours to show tracking data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you see some historical activity on the tracker, you can see realtime data as well, not before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can create as many trackers as you wish, but the plugin configuration only allows to define one (the base use case).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf no tracker is set in the configuration, there will be no tracking session. This means that at a later time, a new (or more) tracker can be created. In this case, a explicit call to \nstartSession()\n should be performed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether the tracker is set in the plugin configuration or manually created, all tracking events will be sent to the server automatically. The implementation buffers tracking events and sends them to the server it batches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nInitialize Google Analytics\n\n\n\n\nModify your Lua code to \ninit()\n the plugin. This can be done anyplace, however it must be done before trying to use the plugin's features.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginGoogleAnalytics:init()\n\n\n\n\nYou can always manually stop recording events at any time by calling:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginGoogleAnalytics:stopSession();\n\n\n\n\nHowever, in-order to record events again you must then manually call:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginGoogleAnalytics:startSession();\n\n\n\n\nLogged data usually shows up within one day.\n\n\nAPI Reference\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginGoogleAnalytics:init()\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitialize the plugin instance.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginGoogleAnalytics:startSession()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analytics session is being explicitly started at plugin initialization time.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginGoogleAnalytics:stopSession()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou normally will never stop a session manually.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginGoogleAnalytics:dispatchHits()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManually request dispatch of hits. By default, data is dispatched from the\nGoogle Analytics SDK for Android every 5 minutes.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginGoogleAnalytics:dispatchPeriodically(seconds)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the dispatch info time period to the desired amount of seconds.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginGoogleAnalytics:stopPeriodicalDispatch()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop periodically sending info.

In this case, a explicit call to \nstartSession()\n should be performed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether the tracker is set in the plugin configuration or manually created, all tracking events will be sent to the server automatically. The implementation buffers tracking events and sends them to the server it batches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nInitialize Google Analytics\n\n\nInitialize the plugin where appropriate in your code.

If you find yourself using these steps, please, after completing, double back and re-read the steps above for other integration items.\n\n\nManual Integration For iOS\n\n\nDrag and drop the following frameworks from the \nplugins/ios\n folder of\nthe\nGoogleAnalytics\n bundle into your Xcode project, check \nCopy items if needed\n when adding frameworks:\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.framework\n\n\nPluginGoogleAnalytics.framework\n\n\n\n\nThe above frameworks depend upon other frameworks. You also need to add the\nfollowing system frameworks, if you don't already have them:\n\n\n\n\nCoreData.framework\n\n\nSecurity.framework\n\n\nSystemConfiguration.framework\n\n\nlibz.dylib\n\n\nlibsqlite3.dylib\n\n\nlibAdIdAccess.a\n\n\nAdSupport.framework\n\n\n\n\nAdd a linker flag, if your setup requires it, to:\n\nTarget -\n Build Settings -\n Linking -\n Other Linker Flags\n:\n\n\n\n\n-force_load /path/to/libAdIdAccess.a\n\n\n\n\nManual Integration For Android\n\n\nSDKBOX supports three different kinds of \nAndroid\n projects \ncommand-line\n, \neclipse\n and \nAndroid Studio\n. \n\n\n\n\nproj.android\n will be used as our \nproject_root\n for \ncommand-line\n and \neclipse\n project\n\n\nproj.android-studio\n will be used as our \nproject_root\n for \nAndroid Studio\n project.\n\n\n\n\nCopy Files\n\n\nCopy the following \njar\n files from \nplugin/android/libs\n folder of this\nbundle into your project\u2019s \nproj.android/libs\n folder.\n\n\n\n\nPluginGoogleAnalytics.jar\n\n\nsdkbox.jar\n\n\n\n\nCopy jni libs\n\n\nCopy and overwrite all the folders from \nplugin/android/jni\n\nto your \nproject_root\n/jni/\n directory.\n\n\n\n\nNote: sdkbox link with \ngnustl\n by default, if your project link with \nc++static\n please replace the files in \nproject_root\n/jni/\nplugin_name\n/libs\n with files in \nproject_root\n/jni/\nplugin_name\n/libs_c++_static\n folder\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nAndroidManifest.xml\n\n\nInclude the following permissions above the \napplication tag\n:\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.INTERNET\n /\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\n /\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.WAKE_LOCK\n /\n\n\n\n\n\nTo enable \nhardware acceleration\n in your \napplication tag\n. This tag is\noptional on newer sdk versions and doesn't work on version 2.3.3.\n\n\nandroid:hardwareAccelerated=\ntrue\n /\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are also a few necessary meta-data tags that also need to be added:\n\n\nmeta-data android:name=\ncom.google.android.gms.version\n\n    android:value=\n@integer/google_play_services_version\n /\n\n\nmeta-data\n    android:name=\ncom.google.android.gms.analytics.globalConfigResource\n\n    android:resource=\n@xml/global_tracker\n /\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, register the \nAnalyticsReceiver\n:\n\n\nreceiver android:name=\ncom.google.android.gms.analytics.AnalyticsReceiver\n\n    android:enabled=\ntrue\n\n    \nintent-filter\n\n        \naction android:name=\ncom.google.android.gms.analytics.ANALYTICS_DISPATCH\n /\n\n    \n/intent-filter\n\n\n/receiver\n\n\nservice android:name=\ncom.google.android.gms.analytics.AnalyticsService\n\n    android:enabled=\ntrue\n\n    android:exported=\nfalse\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to use optional \nReceivers\n, specify them next:\n\n\n!-- Optionally, register CampaignTrackingReceiver and CampaignTrackingService to enable installation campaign reporting --\n\n\nreceiver android:name=\ncom.google.android.gms.analytics.CampaignTrackingReceiver\n\n    android:exported=\ntrue\n\n    \nintent-filter\n\n        \naction android:name=\ncom.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER\n /\n\n    \n/intent-filter\n\n\n/receiver\n\n\nservice android:name=\ncom.google.android.gms.analytics.CampaignTrackingService\n /\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the meta-data files\n\n\nIn the step above a file named \nglobal_tracker.xml\n was specified. This file needs to be created and populated with a few required settings. So where does it go? Take a look again at the code tag from above:\n\n\nmeta-data\n    android:name=\ncom.google.android.gms.analytics.globalConfigResource\n\n    android:resource=\n@xml/global_tracker\n /\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice the \nandroid:resource=\n attribute. This gives you the path of where to create this file, in this case it would be \nproject_root\n/res/xml\n.\n\n\nThis file needs to contain required settings. The contents of this file could be something like this:\n\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n encoding=\nutf-8\n?\n\n\nresources\n\n    \ninteger name=\nga_dispatchPeriod\n300\n/integer\n\n    \nstring name=\nga_logLevel\nverbose\n/string\n\n\n/resources\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nAndroid.mk\n\n\nEdit \nproj.android/jni/Android.mk\n to:\n\n\nAdd additional requirements to \nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES\n:\n\n\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += android_native_app_glue\nLOCAL_LDLIBS += -landroid\nLOCAL_LDLIBS += -llog\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += PluginGoogleAnalytics\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += sdkbox\n\n\n\n\nAdd a call to:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n\n\n\n\nbefore any \nimport-module\n statements.\n\n\nAdd additional \nimport-module\n statements at the end:\n\n\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./plugingoogleanalytics)\n\n\n\n\nThis means that your ordering should look similar to this:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./plugingoogleanalytics)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nAplication.mk\n\n\nEdit \nproj.android/jni/Application.mk\n to:\n\n\nAdd \nAPP_PATFORM\n version requirements:\n\n\nAPP_PLATFORM := android-9\n\n\n\n\nModify \nproject.properties\n\n\nAn \nAndroid Library Reference\n for \nGoogle Play Services\n is required. The\npath will be different depending upon your setup. Also, this is an additional\ndownload that does not come as part of a standard install. To install use the\n\nsdk installer\n and choose \nextras-\ngoogle play services\n. Here is an example of what this line could look like:\n\n\nandroid.library.reference.1=\n../android/sdk.latest/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject/\ngoogle-play-services_lib\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n if you already have an \nandroid.library.reference.1\n you can add\nanother by incrementing the number as \nandroid.library.reference.2\n, etc.\n\n\nModify \n.java\n\n\n\n\nModify \nproj.android/src/\n/\n.java\n to add the following imports:\n\n\n\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, modify the class to edit the \nonCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)\n function to add a call to \nSDKBox.init(this);\n. Example of what this might look like for you:\n\n\n\n\nprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState){\n  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n  SDKBox.init(this);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code. There are a few rules here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has not been defined, \nadd it\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has been defined, add the calls to \nSDKBox\n in the \nsame\n existing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nProguard (optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file. Example:\n\n\n\n\nproguard.config=${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt:proguard-project.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the file you specified to include the following:\n\n\n\n\n# cocos2d-x\n-keep public class org.cocos2dx.** { *; }\n-dontwarn org.cocos2dx.**\n-keep public class com.chukong.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.chukong.**\n\n# google play service\n-keep class com.google.android.gms.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.google.android.gms.**\n\n-keep class * extends java.util.ListResourceBundle {\n    protected Object[][] getContents();\n}\n\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.common.internal.safeparcel.SafeParcelable {\n    public static final *** NULL;\n}\n\n-keepnames @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName class *\n-keepclassmembernames class * {\n    @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName *;\n}\n\n-keepnames class * implements android.os.Parcelable {\n    public static final ** CREATOR;\n}\n\n#sdkbox\n-keep class com.sdkbox.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.sdkbox.**\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Proguard only works with \nRelease\n builds (i.e \ncocos run -m release\n) debug builds do not invoke Proguard rules.",

You may need to add the required entry to the \ninfo.plist\n, under \nLSApplicationQueriesSchemes\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON Configuration\n\n\nSDKBOX Installer will automatically inject a sample configuration to your \nres/sdkbox_config.json\n, that you have to modify it before you can use it for your own app\n\n\nHere is an example of the Google Analytics configuration, you need to replace \nTRACKING_CODE\n  with your specific \nGoogle Analytics Tracking Code\n account information.\n\n\nGoogleAnalytics\n : {\n    \ntrackingCode\n : \nTRACKING_CODE\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nTracker\n\n\nA \ntracker\n is used to aggregate the tracked events. There are some considerations that the developer must review:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou must create a mobile tracker or reuse a previously created one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the tracker is new, it will take up to 24 hours to show tracking data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you see some historical activity on the tracker, you can see realtime data as well, not before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can create as many trackers as you wish, but the plugin configuration only allows to define one (the base use case).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf no tracker is set in the configuration, there will be no tracking session. This means that at a later time, a new (or more) tracker can be created. In this case, a explicit call to \nstartSession()\n should be performed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether the tracker is set in the plugin configuration or manually created, all tracking events will be sent to the server automatically. The implementation buffers tracking events and sends them to the server it batches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nRegister Javascript Functions\n\n\nYou need to register all the Google Analytics JS functions with cocos2d-x before using them.\n\n\nTo do this:\n* Modify \n./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp\n to include the following headers:\n\n\n#include \nPluginGoogleAnalyticsJS.hpp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \n./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp\n make sure to call:\n\n\n\n\nsc-\naddRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginGoogleAnalyticsJS);\n\n\n\n\nInitialize Google Analytics\n\n\nInitialize the plugin by calling \ninit()\n where appropriate in your code. We\nrecommend to do this in the \napp.js\n. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginGoogleAnalytics.init();\n\n\n\n\nYou can always manually stop recording events at any time by calling:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginGoogleAnalytics.stopSession();\n\n\n\n\nHowever, in-order to record events again you must then manually call:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginGoogleAnalytics.startSession();\n\n\n\n\nLogged data usually shows up within one day.\n\n\nAPI Reference\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginGoogleAnalytics.init();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitialize the plugin instance.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginGoogleAnalytics.startSession();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analytics session is being explicitly started at plugin initialization time.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginGoogleAnalytics.stopSession();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou normally will never stop a session manually.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginGoogleAnalytics.dispatchHits();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManually request dispatch of hits. By default, data is dispatched from the\nGoogle Analytics SDK for Android every 5 minutes.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginGoogleAnalytics.dispatchPeriodically(seconds);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the dispatch info time period to the desired amount of seconds.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginGoogleAnalytics.stopPeriodicalDispatch();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop periodically sending info. Then manually the \ndispatchPeridically\n\nor \ndispatchHits\n should be called.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginGoogleAnalytics.logScreen(title);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog screen info. title is the title of a screen. Screens are logical units\ninside your app you'd like to identify at analytics panel.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginGoogleAnalytics.logEvent(eventCategory,\n                                       eventAction,\n                                       eventLabel,\n                                       value);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogleAnalytics::logEvent(\"Achievement\", \"Unlocked\", \"Slay 10 dragons\", 5);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginGoogleAnalytics.logException(exceptionDescription, isFatal);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog an exception.

In any case, the\ntracker associated with tracker id will be set as default tracker for  analytics\noperations.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginGoogleAnalytics.enableTracker(trackerId);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable a tracker identified by a trackerId. If the tracker does not exist,\nnothing will happen.\n\n\n\n\nListeners\n\n\nManual Integration\n\n\nIf the \nSDKBOX Installer\n \nfails\n to complete successfully, it is possible to integrate SDKBOX manually. If the installer complete successfully, please \ndo not\n complete anymore of this document. It is not necessary.\n\n\nThese steps are listed last in this document on purpose as they are seldom needed. If you find yourself using these steps, please, after completing, double back and re-read the steps above for other integration items.\n\n\nManual Integration For iOS\n\n\nDrag and drop the following frameworks from the \nplugins/ios\n folder of\nthe\nGoogleAnalytics\n bundle into your Xcode project, check \nCopy items if needed\n when adding frameworks:\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.framework\n\n\nPluginGoogleAnalytics.framework\n\n\n\n\nThe above frameworks depend upon other frameworks.

The\npath will be different depending upon your setup. Also, this is an additional\ndownload that does not come as part of a standard install. To install use the\n\nsdk installer\n and choose \nextras-\ngoogle play services\n. Here is an example of what this line could look like:\n\n\nandroid.library.reference.1=\n../android/sdk.latest/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject/\ngoogle-play-services_lib\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n if you already have an \nandroid.library.reference.1\n you can add\nanother by incrementing the number as \nandroid.library.reference.2\n, etc.\n\n\nModify \n.java\n\n\n\n\nModify \nproj.android/src/\n/\n.java\n to add the following imports:\n\n\n\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, modify the class to edit the \nonCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)\n function to add a call to \nSDKBox.init(this);\n. Example of what this might look like for you:\n\n\n\n\nprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState){\n  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n  SDKBox.init(this);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code. There are a few rules here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has not been defined, \nadd it\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has been defined, add the calls to \nSDKBox\n in the \nsame\n existing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nProguard (optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file. Example:\n\n\n\n\nproguard.config=${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt:proguard-project.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the file you specified to include the following:\n\n\n\n\n# cocos2d-x\n-keep public class org.cocos2dx.** { *; }\n-dontwarn org.cocos2dx.**\n-keep public class com.chukong.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.chukong.**\n\n# google play service\n-keep class com.google.android.gms.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.google.android.gms.**\n\n-keep class * extends java.util.ListResourceBundle {\n    protected Object[][] getContents();\n}\n\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.common.internal.safeparcel.SafeParcelable {\n    public static final *** NULL;\n}\n\n-keepnames @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName class *\n-keepclassmembernames class * {\n    @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName *;\n}\n\n-keepnames class * implements android.os.Parcelable {\n    public static final ** CREATOR;\n}\n\n#sdkbox\n-keep class com.sdkbox.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.sdkbox.**\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Proguard only works with \nRelease\n builds (i.e \ncocos run -m release\n) debug builds do not invoke Proguard rules.",

The\npath will be different depending upon your setup. Also, this is an additional\ndownload that does not come as part of a standard install. To install use the sdk installer  and choose  extras- google play services . Here is an example of what this line could look like:  android.library.reference.1=\n../android/sdk.latest/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject/\ngoogle-play-services_lib  Note:  if you already have an  android.library.reference.1  you can add\nanother by incrementing the number as  android.library.reference.2 , etc.  Modify  .java   Modify  proj.android/src/ / .java  to add the following imports:   import android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;   Second, modify the class to edit the  onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)  function to add a call to  SDKBox.init(this); . Example of what this might look like for you:   protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState){\n  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n  SDKBox.init(this);\n}    Last, we need to insert the proper  overrides  code. There are a few rules here.    If the method listed has not been defined,  add it .    If the method listed has been defined, add the calls to  SDKBox  in the  same  existing function.          @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }",

You may need to add the required entry to the \ninfo.plist\n, under \nLSApplicationQueriesSchemes\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON Configuration\n\n\nSDKBOX Installer will automatically inject a sample configuration to your \nsdkbox_config.json\n, that you have to modify it before you can use it for your own app\n\n\nHere is an example of the IAP configuration, you need to replace \nput the product id for ios here\n with the product id from your \niTunes Connect\n or  replace \nput your googleplay key here\n from your \nGoogle Play Console\n\n\nios\n :\n{\n    \niap\n:{\n        \nitems\n:{\n            \nremove_ads\n:{\n                \nid\n:\nput the product id for ios here\n\n            }\n        }\n    }\n},\n\nandroid\n:\n{\n    \niap\n:{\n        \nkey\n:\nput your googleplay key here\n,\n        \nitems\n:{\n          \nremove_ads\n:{\n              \nid\n:\nput the product id for android here\n\n          }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf you have IAP items that are \nnon-consumable\n, it is also necessary to supply this for each item in your \nsdkbox_config.json\n. Only \nAndroid\n requires this step. Taking the same \njson\n above your config might now look like this example:\n\n\nandroid\n:\n{\n    \niap\n:{\n        \nkey\n:\nput your googleplay key here\n,\n        \nitems\n:{\n          \nremove_ads\n:{\n              \nid\n:\nput the product id for android here\n,\n              \ntype\n:\nnon_consumable\n\n          }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nInitialize IAP\n\n\nInitialize the plugin where appropriate in your code. We recommend to do this in the \nAppDelegate::applicationDidFinishLaunching()\n or \nAppController:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions()\n. Make sure to include the appropriate headers:\n\n\n#include \nPluginIAP/PluginIAP.h\n\nAppDelegate::applicationDidFinishLaunching()\n{\n     sdkbox::IAP::init();\n}\n\n\n\n\nRetrieve latest Product data\n\n\nIt's always a good idea to retrieve the latest product data from store when your game starts.\n\n\nTo retrieve latest IAP data, simply call \nsdkbox::IAP::refresh()\n.\n\n\n\n\nonProductRequestSuccess\n will be trigged if retrieved successfully.\n\n\nonProductRequestFailure\n will be trigged if exception occurs.\n\n\n\n\nMake a purchase\n\n\nTo make a purchase call \nsdkbox::IAP::purchase(name)\n\n\nNote:\n \nname\n is the name of the IAP item in your config file under \nitems\n tag, not the product id you set in iTunes or GooglePlay Store\n\n\n\n\nonSuccess\n will be triggered if purchase is successful.\n\n\nonFailure\n will be triggered if purchase fails.\n\n\nonCanceled\n will be triggered if purchase is canceled by user.\n\n\n\n\nRestore purchase\n\n\nTo restore purchase call \nsdkbox::IAP::restore()\n.\n\n\n\n\nonRestored\n will be triggered if restore is successful.\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n \nonRestored\n could be triggered multiple times\n\n\nHandling Purchase Events\n\n\nThis allows you to catch the \nIAP\n events so that you can perform operations based upon the response from your players and IAP servers.\n\n\n\n\nAllow your class to extend \nsdkbox::IAPListener\n:\n\n\n\n\n#include \nPluginIAP/PluginIAP.h\n\nclass MyClass : public sdkbox::IAPListener\n{\nprivate:\n  virtual void onInitialized(bool ok) override;\n  virtual void onSuccess(sdkbox::Product const\n p) override;\n  virtual void onFailure(sdkbox::Product const\n p, const std::string \nmsg) override;\n  virtual void onCanceled(sdkbox::Product const\n p) override;\n  virtual void onRestored(sdkbox::Product const\n p) override;\n  virtual void onProductRequestSuccess(std::vector\nsdkbox::Product\n const \nproducts) override;\n  virtual void onProductRequestFailure(const std::string \nmsg) override;\n  void onRestoreComplete(bool ok, const std::string \nmsg);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a \nlistener\n that handles callbacks:\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox::IAP::setListener(listener);\n\n\n\n\nAPI Reference\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nstatic void init ( ) ;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitialize SDKBox IAP\n\n\n\n\nstatic void setDebug ( bool debug ) ;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable/disable debug logging\n\n\n\n\nstatic void purchase ( const std::string \n name ) ;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake a purchase request\n\n\n\n\nstatic void refresh ( ) ;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefresh the IAP data(title, price, description)\n\n\n\n\nstatic void restore ( ) ;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestore purchase\n\n\n\n\nstatic void setListener ( IAPListener * listener ) ;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet listener for IAP\n\n\n\n\nstatic void removeListener ( ) ;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove listener for IAP\n\n\n\n\nListeners\n\n\nvoid onInitialized ( bool ok );\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalled when IAP initialized\n\n\n\n\nvoid onSuccess ( const Product \n p );\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalled when an IAP processed successfully\n\n\n\n\nvoid onFailure ( const Product \n p , const std::string \n msg );\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalled when an IAP fails\n\n\n\n\nvoid onCanceled ( const Product \n p );\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalled when user canceled the IAP\n\n\n\n\nvoid onRestored ( const Product \n p );\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalled when server returns the IAP items user already purchased\n@note this callback will be called multiple times if there are multiple IAP\n\n\n\n\nvoid onProductRequestSuccess ( const std::vector \nProduct\n \n products );\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalled the product request is successful, usually developers use product request to update the latest info(title, price) from IAP\n\n\n\n\nvoid onProductRequestFailure ( const std::string \n msg );\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalled when the product request fails\n\n\n\n\nvoid onRestoreComplete ( bool ok , const std::string \n msg );\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalled when the restore completed\n\n\n\n\nManual Integration\n\n\nIf the \nSDKBOX Installer\n \nfails\n to complete successfully, it is possible to integrate SDKBOX manually.

JSON Configuration  SDKBOX Installer will automatically inject a sample configuration to your  sdkbox_config.json , that you have to modify it before you can use it for your own app  Here is an example of the IAP configuration, you need to replace  put the product id for ios here  with the product id from your  iTunes Connect  or  replace  put your googleplay key here  from your  Google Play Console  ios  :\n{\n     iap :{\n         items :{\n             remove_ads :{\n                 id : put the product id for ios here \n            }\n        }\n    }\n}, android :\n{\n     iap :{\n         key : put your googleplay key here ,\n         items :{\n           remove_ads :{\n               id : put the product id for android here \n          }\n        }\n    }\n}  If you have IAP items that are  non-consumable , it is also necessary to supply this for each item in your  sdkbox_config.json . Only  Android  requires this step. Taking the same  json  above your config might now look like this example:  android :\n{\n     iap :{\n         key : put your googleplay key here ,\n         items :{\n           remove_ads :{\n               id : put the product id for android here ,\n               type : non_consumable \n          }\n        }\n    }\n}",

To retrieve latest IAP data, simply call  sdkbox::IAP::refresh() .   onProductRequestSuccess  will be trigged if retrieved successfully.  onProductRequestFailure  will be trigged if exception occurs.   Make a purchase  To make a purchase call  sdkbox::IAP::purchase(name)  Note:   name  is the name of the IAP item in your config file under  items  tag, not the product id you set in iTunes or GooglePlay Store   onSuccess  will be triggered if purchase is successful.  onFailure  will be triggered if purchase fails.  onCanceled  will be triggered if purchase is canceled by user.   Restore purchase  To restore purchase call  sdkbox::IAP::restore() .   onRestored  will be triggered if restore is successful.   Note:   onRestored  could be triggered multiple times  Handling Purchase Events  This allows you to catch the  IAP  events so that you can perform operations based upon the response from your players and IAP servers.

Modify  Application.mk  (Cocos2d-x v3.0 - v3.2 only)  Edit  project_root /jni/Application.mk  to make sure  APP_STL  is defined\ncorrectly. If  Application.mk  contains  APP_STL := c++_static , it should be\nchanged to:  APP_STL := gnustl_static  Modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java    If you're using cocos2d-x from source, assuming you are in the  proj.android  directory,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  is located:  ../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/\nlib/Cocos2dxActivity.java    If you're using the prebuilt cocos2d-x libraries assuming you are in the  proj.android  directory,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  is located:  ./src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java    Note:  When using Cocos2d-x from source, different versions have  Cocos2dxActivity.java  in a different location.

The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to  onLoadNativeLibraries(); . Example:   onLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);    Last, we need to insert the proper  overrides  code. There are a few rules here.    If the method listed has not been defined,  add it .    If the method listed has been defined, add the calls to  SDKBox  in the  same  existing function.          @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }  Modify  project.properties  An  Android Library Reference  for  Google Play Services  is required. The\npath will be different depending upon your setup. Also, this is an additional\ndownload that does not come as part of a standard install. To install use the sdk installer  and choose  extras- google play services . Here is an example of what this line could look like:  android.library.reference.1=\n../android/sdk.latest/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject/\ngoogle-play-services_lib  Note:  if you already have an  android.library.reference.1  you can add\nanother by incrementing the number as  android.library.reference.2 , etc.",

One way to find the location is to look in \nproj.android/project.properties\n. Example:\n  \nandroid.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java\n\n\nIn this case, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n should be located at:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to add the following imports:\n\n\n\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, modify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to edit the \nonCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)\n function to add a call to \nSDKBox.init(this);\n. The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to \nonLoadNativeLibraries();\n. Example:\n\n\n\n\nonLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code.

The\npath will be different depending upon your setup. Also, this is an additional\ndownload that does not come as part of a standard install. To install use the\n\nsdk installer\n and choose \nextras-\ngoogle play services\n. Here is an example of what this line could look like:\n\n\nandroid.library.reference.1=\n../android/sdk.latest/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject/\ngoogle-play-services_lib\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n if you already have an \nandroid.library.reference.1\n you can add\nanother by incrementing the number as \nandroid.library.reference.2\n, etc.\n\n\nProguard (optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file.

Modify  Application.mk  (Cocos2d-x v3.0 - v3.2 only)  Edit  project_root /jni/Application.mk  to make sure  APP_STL  is defined\ncorrectly. If  Application.mk  contains  APP_STL := c++_static , it should be\nchanged to:  APP_STL := gnustl_static  Copy all source and header files from  plugin/luabindings/  to your projects  Classes  folder.

The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to  onLoadNativeLibraries(); . Example:   onLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);    Last, we need to insert the proper  overrides  code. There are a few rules here.    If the method listed has not been defined,  add it .    If the method listed has been defined, add the calls to  SDKBox  in the  same  existing function.          @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }  Modify  project.properties  An  Android Library Reference  for  Google Play Services  is required. The\npath will be different depending upon your setup. Also, this is an additional\ndownload that does not come as part of a standard install. To install use the sdk installer  and choose  extras- google play services . Here is an example of what this line could look like:  android.library.reference.1=\n../android/sdk.latest/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject/\ngoogle-play-services_lib  Note:  if you already have an  android.library.reference.1  you can add\nanother by incrementing the number as  android.library.reference.2 , etc.",

The\npath will be different depending upon your setup. Also, this is an additional\ndownload that does not come as part of a standard install. To install use the\n\nsdk installer\n and choose \nextras-\ngoogle play services\n.

You may need to add the required entry to the \ninfo.plist\n, under \nLSApplicationQueriesSchemes\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON Configuration\n\n\nSDKBOX Installer will automatically inject a sample configuration to your \nres/sdkbox_config.json\n, that you have to modify it before you can use it for your own app\n\n\nHere is an example of the InMobi configuration, you need to replace \naccount_id\n item with your specific \nInMobi\n account information.\n\n\nInMobi\n:{\n    \ninterstitial_placement_id\n: \n1449919424310\n,       //interstitial id\n    \naccount_id\n: \n922cc696d9fa475097651b5cad78567d\n, \n    \nbanner_h\n: 50,                                     //banner height\n    \nbanner_placement_id\n: \n1447081423897\n              //remove if needn't\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nRegister Javascript Functions\n\n\nYou need to register all the InMobi JS functions with cocos2d-x before using them.\n\n\nTo do this:\n* Modify \n./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp\n to include the following headers:\n\n\n#include \nPluginInMobiJS.hpp\n\n#include \nPluginInMobiJSHelper.h\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \n./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp\n make sure to call:\n\n\n\n\nsc-\naddRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginInMobiJS);\nsc-\naddRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginInMobiJS_helper);\n\n\n\n\nInitialize InMobi\n\n\nInitialize the plugin by calling \ninit()\n where appropriate in your code. We\nrecommend to do this in the \napp.js\n. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.init();\n\n\n\n\nShow Interstitial\n\n\nAfter initialization you can begin to use the InMobi functionality. Use \nshowInterstitial\n wherever you want from your code:\n\n\n// Manually Loading Ads\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.loadInterstitial();\n\n// show interstitial\nif (sdkbox.PluginInMobi.isInterstitialReady()) {\n    console.log('inmobi interstitial ad is ready');\n    sdkbox.PluginInMobi.showInterstitial();\n} else {\n    console.log('inmobi interstitial ad is not ready');\n}\n\n\n\n\nSet Log level\n\n\nYou can set log level with follow function\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setLogLevel(sdkbox.PluginInMobi.SBIMSDKLogLevel.kIMSDKLogLevelDebug);\n\n\n\n\nSet user data\n\n\nYou can use following functions to set user data\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.addIdForType(\ntest\n, sdkbox.PluginInMobi.SBIMSDKIdType.kIMSDKIdTypeLogin);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.removeIdType(sdkbox.PluginInMobi.SBIMSDKIdType.kIMSDKIdTypeLogin);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setAge(18);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setAreaCode(\narea code\n);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setAgeGroup(sdkbox.PluginInMobi.SBIMSDKAgeGroup.kIMSDKAgeGroupBetween18And20);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setYearOfBirth(1989);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setEducation(sdkbox.PluginInMobi.SBIMSDKEducation.kIMSDKEducationHighSchoolOrLess);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setEthnicity(sdkbox.PluginInMobi.SBIMSDKEthnicity.kIMSDKEthnicityHispanic);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setGender(sdkbox.PluginInMobi.SBIMSDKGender.kIMSDKGenderMale);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setHouseholdIncome(sdkbox.PluginInMobi.SBIMSDKHouseholdIncome.kIMSDKHouseholdIncomeBelow5kUSD);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setIncome(4500);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setInterests(\ngame\n);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setLanguage(\nzh-cn\n);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setLocation(\ncd\n, \nsc\n, \nusa\n);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setLocation(102, 348);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setNationality(\nnationality\n);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setPostalCode(\n618000\n);\n\n\n\n\nCatch InMobi events (optional)\n\n\nThis allows you to catch the \nInMobi\n events so that you can perform operations based upon responses. A simple example might look like this:\n\n\nvar plugin = sdkbox.PluginInMobi\nplugin.setListener({\n    bannerDidFinishLoading: function() { console.log('bannerDidFinishLoading'); },\n

\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES\n:\n\n\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += PluginInMobi\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += sdkbox\n\n\n\n\nAdd a call to:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n\n\n\n\nbefore any \nimport-module\n statements.\n\n\nAdd additional \nimport-module\n statements at the end:\n\n\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./plugininmobi)\n\n\n\n\nThis means that your ordering should look similar to this:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./plugininmobi)\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n It is important to make sure these statements are above the existing \n$(call import-module,./prebuilt-mk)\n statement, if you are using the pre-built libraries.\n\n\nModify \nApplication.mk\n (Cocos2d-x v3.0 to v3.2 only)\n\n\nEdit \nproject_root\n/jni/Application.mk\n to make sure \nAPP_STL\n is defined\ncorrectly. If \nApplication.mk\n contains \nAPP_STL := c++_static\n, it should be\nchanged to:\n\n\nAPP_STL := gnustl_static\n\n\n\n\nCopy all source and header files from \nplugin/jsbindings/\n to your projects \nClasses\n folder.\n\n\nAdd all \n.cpp\n files, that you just copied, to \nAndroid.mk\n in the \nLOCAL_SRC_FILES\n section. Example\n\n\nLOCAL_SRC_FILES := hellocpp/main.cpp \\\n                  ../../Classes/AppDelegate.cpp \\\n                  ../../Classes/HelloWorldScene.cpp \\\n                                    ../../Classes/NewSourceFile.cpp\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using cocos2d-x from source, assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/\nlib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using the prebuilt cocos2d-x libraries assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n./src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n When using Cocos2d-x from source, different versions have \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n in a different location. One way to find the location is to look in \nproj.android/project.properties\n. Example:\n  \nandroid.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java\n\n\nIn this case, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n should be located at:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to add the following imports:\n\n\n\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, modify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to edit the \nonCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)\n function to add a call to \nSDKBox.init(this);\n. The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to \nonLoadNativeLibraries();\n. Example:\n\n\n\n\nonLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code. There are a few rules here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has not been defined, \nadd it\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has been defined, add the calls to \nSDKBox\n in the \nsame\n existing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nProguard (optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file. Example:\n\n\n\n\nproguard.config=${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt:proguard-project.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the file you specified to include the following:\n\n\n\n\n# inmobi\n-keep class com.inmobi.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.inmobi.**\n\n\n# cocos2d-x\n-keep public class org.cocos2dx.** { *; }\n-dontwarn org.cocos2dx.**\n-keep public class com.chukong.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.chukong.**\n\n# google play service\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.** { public *; }\n-dontwarn com.google.android.gms.**\n\n-keep class * extends java.util.ListResourceBundle {\n    protected Object[][] getContents();\n}\n\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.common.internal.safeparcel.SafeParcelable {\n    public static final *** NULL;\n}\n\n-keepnames @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName class *\n-keepclassmembernames class * {\n    @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName *;\n}\n\n-keepnames class * implements android.os.Parcelable {\n    public static final ** CREATOR;\n}\n\n#sdkbox\n-keep public class com.sdkbox.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.sdkbox.**\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Proguard only works with \nRelease\n builds (i.e \ncocos run -m release\n) debug builds do not invoke Proguard rules.",

Add additional  import-module  statements at the end:  $(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./plugininmobi)  This means that your ordering should look similar to this:  $(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./plugininmobi)  Note:  It is important to make sure these statements are above the existing  $(call import-module,./prebuilt-mk)  statement, if you are using the pre-built libraries.  Modify  Application.mk  (Cocos2d-x v3.0 to v3.2 only)  Edit  project_root /jni/Application.mk  to make sure  APP_STL  is defined\ncorrectly.

One way to find the location is to look in  proj.android/project.properties . Example:\n   android.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java  In this case,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  should be located at:  ../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java   Modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to add the following imports:   import android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;   Second, modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to edit the  onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)  function to add a call to  SDKBox.init(this); .

\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES\n:\n\n\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += PluginInMobi\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += sdkbox\n\n\n\n\nAdd a call to:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n\n\n\n\nbefore any \nimport-module\n statements.\n\n\nAdd additional \nimport-module\n statements at the end:\n\n\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./plugininmobi)\n\n\n\n\nThis means that your ordering should look similar to this:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./plugininmobi)\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n It is important to make sure these statements are above the existing \n$(call import-module,./prebuilt-mk)\n statement, if you are using the pre-built libraries.\n\n\nModify \nApplication.mk\n (Cocos2d-x v3.0 to v3.2 only)\n\n\nEdit \nproject_root\n/jni/Application.mk\n to make sure \nAPP_STL\n is defined\ncorrectly. If \nApplication.mk\n contains \nAPP_STL := c++_static\n, it should be\nchanged to:\n\n\nAPP_STL := gnustl_static\n\n\n\n\nCopy all source and header files from \nplugin/luabindings/\n to your projects \nClasses\n folder.\n\n\nAdd all \n.cpp\n files, that you just copied, to \nAndroid.mk\n in the \nLOCAL_SRC_FILES\n section. Example\n\n\nLOCAL_SRC_FILES := hellocpp/main.cpp \\\n                ../../Classes/AppDelegate.cpp \\\n                ../../Classes/HelloWorldScene.cpp \\\n                                ../../Classes/NewSourceFile.cpp\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using cocos2d-x from source, assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/\nlib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using the prebuilt cocos2d-x libraries assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n./src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n When using Cocos2d-x from source, different versions have \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n in a different location. One way to find the location is to look in \nproj.android/project.properties\n. Example:\n  \nandroid.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java\n\n\nIn this case, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n should be located at:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to add the following imports:\n\n\n\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, modify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to edit the \nonCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)\n function to add a call to \nSDKBox.init(this);\n. The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to \nonLoadNativeLibraries();\n. Example:\n\n\n\n\nonLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code. There are a few rules here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has not been defined, \nadd it\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has been defined, add the calls to \nSDKBox\n in the \nsame\n existing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nProguard (optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file. Example:\n\n\n\n\nproguard.config=${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt:proguard-project.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the file you specified to include the following:\n\n\n\n\n# inmobi\n-keep class com.inmobi.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.inmobi.**\n\n\n# cocos2d-x\n-keep public class org.cocos2dx.** { *; }\n-dontwarn org.cocos2dx.**\n-keep public class com.chukong.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.chukong.**\n\n# google play service\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.** { public *; }\n-dontwarn com.google.android.gms.**\n\n-keep class * extends java.util.ListResourceBundle {\n    protected Object[][] getContents();\n}\n\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.common.internal.safeparcel.SafeParcelable {\n    public static final *** NULL;\n}\n\n-keepnames @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName class *\n-keepclassmembernames class * {\n    @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName *;\n}\n\n-keepnames class * implements android.os.Parcelable {\n    public static final ** CREATOR;\n}\n\n#sdkbox\n-keep public class com.sdkbox.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.sdkbox.**\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Proguard only works with \nRelease\n builds (i.e \ncocos run -m release\n) debug builds do not invoke Proguard rules.",

You may need to add the required entry to the \ninfo.plist\n, under \nLSApplicationQueriesSchemes\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON Configuration\n\n\nSDKBOX Installer will automatically inject a sample configuration to your \nres/sdkbox_config.json\n, that you have to modify it before you can use it for your own app\n\n\nHere is an example of the InMobi configuration, you need to replace \naccount_id\n item with your specific \nInMobi\n account information.\n\n\nInMobi\n:{\n    \ninterstitial_placement_id\n: \n1449919424310\n,       //interstitial id\n    \naccount_id\n: \n922cc696d9fa475097651b5cad78567d\n, \n    \nbanner_h\n: 50,                                     //banner height\n    \nbanner_placement_id\n: \n1447081423897\n              //remove if needn't\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nRegister Javascript Functions\n\n\nYou need to register all the InMobi JS functions with cocos2d-x before using them.\n\n\nTo do this:\n* Modify \n./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp\n to include the following headers:\n\n\n#include \nPluginInMobiJS.hpp\n\n#include \nPluginInMobiJSHelper.h\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \n./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp\n make sure to call:\n\n\n\n\nsc-\naddRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginInMobiJS);\nsc-\naddRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginInMobiJS_helper);\n\n\n\n\nInitialize InMobi\n\n\nInitialize the plugin by calling \ninit()\n where appropriate in your code. We\nrecommend to do this in the \napp.js\n. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.init();\n\n\n\n\nShow Interstitial\n\n\nAfter initialization you can begin to use the InMobi functionality. Use \nshowInterstitial\n wherever you want from your code:\n\n\n// Manually Loading Ads\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.loadInterstitial();\n\n// show interstitial\nif (sdkbox.PluginInMobi.isInterstitialReady()) {\n    console.log('inmobi interstitial ad is ready');\n    sdkbox.PluginInMobi.showInterstitial();\n} else {\n    console.log('inmobi interstitial ad is not ready');\n}\n\n\n\n\nSet Log level\n\n\nYou can set log level with follow function\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setLogLevel(sdkbox.PluginInMobi.SBIMSDKLogLevel.kIMSDKLogLevelDebug);\n\n\n\n\nSet user data\n\n\nYou can use following functions to set user data\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.addIdForType(\ntest\n, sdkbox.PluginInMobi.SBIMSDKIdType.kIMSDKIdTypeLogin);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.removeIdType(sdkbox.PluginInMobi.SBIMSDKIdType.kIMSDKIdTypeLogin);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setAge(18);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setAreaCode(\narea code\n);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setAgeGroup(sdkbox.PluginInMobi.SBIMSDKAgeGroup.kIMSDKAgeGroupBetween18And20);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setYearOfBirth(1989);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setEducation(sdkbox.PluginInMobi.SBIMSDKEducation.kIMSDKEducationHighSchoolOrLess);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setEthnicity(sdkbox.PluginInMobi.SBIMSDKEthnicity.kIMSDKEthnicityHispanic);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setGender(sdkbox.PluginInMobi.SBIMSDKGender.kIMSDKGenderMale);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setHouseholdIncome(sdkbox.PluginInMobi.SBIMSDKHouseholdIncome.kIMSDKHouseholdIncomeBelow5kUSD);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setIncome(4500);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setInterests(\ngame\n);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setLanguage(\nzh-cn\n);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setLocation(\ncd\n, \nsc\n, \nusa\n);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setLocation(102, 348);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setNationality(\nnationality\n);\nsdkbox.PluginInMobi.setPostalCode(\n618000\n);\n\n\n\n\nCatch InMobi events (optional)\n\n\nThis allows you to catch the \nInMobi\n events so that you can perform operations based upon responses. A simple example might look like this:\n\n\nvar plugin = sdkbox.PluginInMobi\nplugin.setListener({\n    bannerDidFinishLoading: function() { console.log('bannerDidFinishLoading'); },\n

One way to find the location is to look in \nproj.android/project.properties\n. Example:\n  \nandroid.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java\n\n\nIn this case, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n should be located at:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to add the following imports:\n\n\n\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, modify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to edit the \nonCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)\n function to add a call to \nSDKBox.init(this);\n. The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to \nonLoadNativeLibraries();\n. Example:\n\n\n\n\nonLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code.

We recommend to do this in the \nAppDelegate::applicationDidFinishLaunching()\n or \nAppController:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions()\n. Make sure to include the appropriate headers:\n\n\n#include \nPluginReview/PluginReview.h\n\nAppDelegate::applicationDidFinishLaunching()\n{\n     sdkbox::PluginReview::init();\n}\n\n\n\n\nSetting Review (optional)\n\n\nYou can set a custom string for the rate prompt, if you don't want to use the default string.\n\n\nNote:\n if you set \ntryPromptWhenInit\n to \ntrue\n which is in \nsdkbox.config\n, you must call the following functions before \ninit()\n:\n\n\nsdkbox::PluginReview::setTitle(\ncustom title\n);\nsdkbox::PluginReview::setMessage(\ncustom message\n);\nsdkbox::PluginReview::setCancelButtonTitle(\ncustom cancel\n);\nsdkbox::PluginReview::setRateButtonTitle(\ncustom rate\n);\nsdkbox::PluginReview::setRateLaterButtonTitle(\ncustom rate later\n);\n\n\n\n\nAfter initialization you can begin to use the Review functionality.\nUse \nshow\n to display rate prompt:\n\n\nsdkbox::PluginReview::show();\n\n\n\n\nIf you set \nUserEventLimit\n to something other than 0 in \nsdkbox.config\n, you must call \nuserDidSignificantEvent\n to increase user event count. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox::PluginReview::userDidSignificantEvent(true);\n\n\n\n\nCatch Review events (optional)\n\n\nThis allows you to catch the \nReview\n events so that you can perform operations based upon responses.

One way to find the location is to look in \nproj.android/project.properties\n. Example:\n  \nandroid.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java\n\n\nIn this case, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n should be located at:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to add the following imports:\n\n\n\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, modify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to edit the \nonCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)\n function to add a call to \nSDKBox.init(this);\n. The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to \nonLoadNativeLibraries();\n. Example:\n\n\n\n\nonLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code. There are a few rules here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has not been defined, \nadd it\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has been defined, add the calls to \nSDKBox\n in the \nsame\n existing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nProguard (release, optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file.

We\nrecommend to do this in the \napp.js\n. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginReview.init();\n\n\n\n\nSetting Review (optional)\n\n\nYou can set a custom string for the rate prompt, if you don't want to use the default string.\n\n\nNote:\n if you set \ntryPromptWhenInit\n to \ntrue\n which is in \nsdkbox.config\n, you must call the following functions before \ninit()\n:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginReview.setTitle(\ncustom title\n);\nsdkbox.PluginReview.setMessage(\ncustom message\n);\nsdkbox.PluginReview.setCancelButtonTitle(\ncustom cancel\n);\nsdkbox.PluginReview.setRateButtonTitle(\ncustom rate\n);\nsdkbox.PluginReview.setRateLaterButtonTitle(\ncustom rate later\n);\n\n\n\n\nAfter initialization you can begin to use the Review functionality.\nUse \nshow\n try to display rate prompt:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginReview.show();\n\n\n\n\nIf you set \nUserEventLimit\n not 0 in \nsdkbox.config\n, you must call \nuserDidSignificantEvent\n increase user event count: \nuserDidSignificantEvent\n increase user event count\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginReview.userDidSignificantEvent(true);\n\n\n\n\nCatch Review events (optional)\n\n\nThis allows you to catch the \nReview\n events so that you can perform operations based upon responses. A simple example might look like this:\n\n\nvar plugin = sdkbox.PluginReview\nplugin.setListener({\n  onDisplayAlert: function(data) {cc.log(\ndidDisplayAlert\n)},\n  onDeclineToRate: function(data) { cc.log(\ndidDeclineToRate\n) },\n  onRate: function(data) { cc.log(\ndidToRate\n) },\n  onRemindLater: function(data) { cc.log(\ndidToRemindLater\n) }\n})\nplugin.init()\n\n\n\n\nAPI Reference\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginReview.init();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitialize the plugin instance.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginReview.setListener(listener);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet listener to listen for adcolony events\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginReview.show(force);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTells 'SDKBox review plugin' to try and show the prompt (a rating alert).\nif you call \nshow\n with \nfalse\n or null params,\nthe prompt will be showed if there is connection available,\nthe user hasn't declined to rate or hasn't rated current version.\nif the item \ntryPromptWhenInit\n in sdkbox.config is false, you can call this try to show prompt\nif you call \nshow\n with \ntrue\n params\nthe prompt will be showed without checks (the prompt is always displayed).\nThe case where you should call this is if your app has an\nexplicit \"Rate this app\" command somewhere.

We\nrecommend to do this in the \napp.js\n. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginReview.init();\n\n\n\n\nSetting Review (optional)\n\n\nYou can set a custom string for the rate prompt, if you don't want to use the default string.\n\n\nNote:\n if you set \ntryPromptWhenInit\n to \ntrue\n which is in \nsdkbox.config\n, you must call the following functions before \ninit()\n:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginReview.setTitle(\ncustom title\n);\nsdkbox.PluginReview.setMessage(\ncustom message\n);\nsdkbox.PluginReview.setCancelButtonTitle(\ncustom cancel\n);\nsdkbox.PluginReview.setRateButtonTitle(\ncustom rate\n);\nsdkbox.PluginReview.setRateLaterButtonTitle(\ncustom rate later\n);\n\n\n\n\nAfter initialization you can begin to use the Review functionality.\nUse \nshow\n try to display rate prompt:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginReview.show();\n\n\n\n\nIf you set \nUserEventLimit\n not 0 in \nsdkbox.config\n, you must call \nuserDidSignificantEvent\n increase user event count: \nuserDidSignificantEvent\n increase user event count\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginReview.userDidSignificantEvent(true);\n\n\n\n\nCatch Review events (optional)\n\n\nThis allows you to catch the \nReview\n events so that you can perform operations based upon responses. A simple example might look like this:\n\n\nvar plugin = sdkbox.PluginReview\nplugin.setListener({\n  onDisplayAlert: function(data) {cc.log(\ndidDisplayAlert\n)},\n  onDeclineToRate: function(data) { cc.log(\ndidDeclineToRate\n) },\n  onRate: function(data) { cc.log(\ndidToRate\n) },\n  onRemindLater: function(data) { cc.log(\ndidToRemindLater\n) }\n})\nplugin.init()\n\n\n\n\nAPI Reference\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginReview.init();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitialize the plugin instance.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginReview.setListener(listener);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet listener to listen for adcolony events\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginReview.show(force);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTells 'SDKBox review plugin' to try and show the prompt (a rating alert).\nif you call \nshow\n with \nfalse\n or null params,\nthe prompt will be showed if there is connection available,\nthe user hasn't declined to rate or hasn't rated current version.\nif the item \ntryPromptWhenInit\n in sdkbox.config is false, you can call this try to show prompt\nif you call \nshow\n with \ntrue\n params\nthe prompt will be showed without checks (the prompt is always displayed).\nThe case where you should call this is if your app has an\nexplicit \"Rate this app\" command somewhere. This is similar to rateApp,\nbut instead of jumping to the review directly, an intermediary prompt is displayed.\nanother case is for debug\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginReview.userDidSignificantEvent(canPromptForRating);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginReview.setTitle(title);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginReview.setMessage(message);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginReview.setCancelButtonTitle(cancelTitle);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginReview.setRateButtonTitle(rateTitle);\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginReview.setRateLaterButtonTitle(rateLaterTitle);\n\n\n\n\nListeners\n\n\nonDisplayAlert();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when alert prompt show\n\n\n\n\nonDeclineToRate();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when user refuse to rate\n\n\n\n\nonRate();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when user want to rate\n\n\n\n\nonRemindLater();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrigger when user want to remind later\n\n\n\n\nManual Integration\n\n\nIf the \nSDKBOX Installer\n \nfails\n to complete successfully, it is possible to integrate SDKBOX manually. If the installer complete successfully, please \ndo not\n complete anymore of this document. It is not necessary.\n\n\nThese steps are listed last in this document on purpose as they are seldom needed.

Make sure you setup the SDKBOX installer correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbash\n  $ sdkbox import soomlagrow\n\n\nImportant Notice\n\n\nIf you upgraded to Xcode7 you need to perform the following steps to your project for plugin to function correctly.\n\n\nDisable App Transport Security\n\n\nAdding the following entry to the plist:\n\n\nkey\nNSAppTransportSecurity\n/key\n\n\ndict\n\n    \nkey\nNSAllowsArbitraryLoads\n/key\n\n    \ntrue/\n\n\n/dict\n\n\n\n\n\nDisable Bitcode support\n\n\nYou have to turn off \nBitcode\n support. If you don't cocos2d-x will fail to build.\n\n\nSet your game requires full screen\n\n\nIf your game doesn't support all screen orientations you will need to check \nRequires full screen\n in Xcode. If you do not, your app will fail Apple's submission process.\n\n\nWhitelist canOpenURL function\n\n\nThis depends on what plugins are in your project. You may need to add the required entry to the \ninfo.plist\n, under \nLSApplicationQueriesSchemes\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON Configuration\n\n\nSDKBOX Installer will automatically inject a sample configuration to your \nres/sdkbox_config.json\n, that you will have to modify before you use in your own app.\n\n\nHere is an example of the GROW configuration, you need to replace \ngameKey\n and \nenvkey\n items with the ones you were given by the \nGROW Dashboard\n. You will probably use the same \ngameKey\n and \nenvKey\n for Android and iOS but you will still need to specify it twice, once for each platform. Example:\n\n\nios\n :\n{\n  \nsoomlaGrow\n:{\n              \ngameKey\n:\n0cbc07e3-0f0c-4b68-bb0c-061c1b5fb553\n,\n              \nenvKey\n:\n8b865add-4541-4db1-be18-f6c7e5e00564\n\n          }\n}\n\nandroid\n :\n{\n  \nsoomlaGrow\n:{\n              \ngameKey\n:\n0cbc07e3-0f0c-4b68-bb0c-061c1b5fb553\n,\n              \nenvKey\n:\n8b865add-4541-4db1-be18-f6c7e5e00564\n\n          }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nInitialize SoomlaGrow\n\n\nModify your Lua code to \ninit()\n the plugin. This can be done anyplace, however it must be done before trying to use the plugin's features.\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginSoomlaGrow:init()\n\n\n\n\nUsing GROW's Insights module\n\n\nAfter initialization you can begin to use the Insights functionality. Use \nrefreshInsight\n, \ngetUserInsightInfo\n wherever you want from your code:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginSoomlaGrow:refreshInsight()\nsdkbox.PluginSoomlaGrow:getUserInsightInfo()\n\n\n\n\nCatch GROW events (optional)\n\n\nThis allows you to catch the \nSOOMLA Grow\n events so that you can perform operations based upon responses. A simple example might look like this:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginSoomlaGrow:setListener(function(data)\n            if \nonHighWayInitialized\n == data.event then\n                //highway initialized\n            elseif \nonHighWayConnected\n == data.event then\n                //highway connected\n            elseif \nonHighWayDisconnected\n == data.event then\n                //highway disconnected\n            end\n        end)\nsdkbox.PluginSoomlaGrow:init()\n\n\n\n\nAPI Reference\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginSoomlaGrow:init()\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitialize the plugin instance.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginSoomlaGrow:setListener(listener)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet listener to listen for GROW events\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginSoomlaGrow:refreshInsight()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefreshed Insights information from the server\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginSoomlaGrow:getUserInsightInfo()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nget user insight info\n Note: the returned value may be empty\n\n\n\n\nListeners\n\n\nonHighWayInitialized()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis event is triggered once the highway initialized.\n\n\n\n\nonHighWayConnected()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis event is triggered once the highway is connected to server.\n\n\n\n\nonHighWayDisconnected()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis event is triggered once the highway disconnect from the server.\n\n\n\n\nManual Integration\n\n\nIf the \nSDKBOX Installer\n \nfails\n to complete successfully, it is possible to integrate SDKBOX manually. If the installer complete successfully, please \ndo not\n complete anymore of this document. It is not necessary.\n\n\nThese steps are listed last in this document on purpose as they are seldom needed. If you find yourself using these steps, please, after completing, double back and re-read the steps above for other integration items.\n\n\nManual Integration For iOS\n\n\nDrag and drop the following frameworks from the \nplugins/ios\n folder of the \nSOOMLA Grow\n bundle into your Xcode project, check \nCopy items if needed\n when adding frameworks:\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.framework\n\n\nPluginSoomlaGrow.framework\n\n\n\n\nThe above frameworks depend upon a large number of other frameworks. You also need to add the following system frameworks, if you don't already have them:\n\n\n\n\nSecurity.framework\n\n\nlibsqlite3.0.dylib\n\n\nStoreKit.framework\n\n\nCFNetwork.framework\n\n\nlibicucore.dylib\n\n\nSystemConfguration.framework\n\n\nAdSupport.framework\n\n\n\n\nCopy all source and header files from \nplugin/luabindings/\n to your projects \nClasses\n folder.\n\n\nAdd these same files, that you just copied, to Xcode by either dragging and dropping them into Xcode or by using \nFile -\n Add files to...\n.\n\n\nManual Integration For Android\n\n\nSDKBOX supports three different kinds of \nAndroid\n projects \ncommand-line\n, \neclipse\n and \nAndroid Studio\n. \n\n\n\n\nproj.android\n will be used as our \nproject_root\n for \ncommand-line\n and \neclipse\n project\n\n\nproj.android-studio\n will be used as our \nproject_root\n for \nAndroid Studio\n project.\n\n\n\n\nCopy Files\n\n\nCopy the following \njar\n files from \nplugin/android/libs\n folder of this\nbundle into your project\u2019s \n/libs\n folder.\n\n\n\n\nSoomlaGrowLite.jar\n\n\nPluginSoomlaGrow.jar\n\n\nsdkbox.jar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using cocos2d-x from source copy the \njar\n files to:\n\n\nAndroid command-line:\n\ncocos2d/cocos/platform/android/java/libs\n\n\nAndroid Studio:\n\ncocos2d/cocos/platform/android/libcocos2dx/libs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using cocos2d-js or lua copy the \njar\n files to:\n\n\nAndroid command-line:\n\nframeworks/cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/libs\n\n\nAndroid Studio:\n\nframeworks/cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/libcocos2dx/libs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using prebuilt cocos2d-x copy the \njar\n files to:\n\n\nAndroid command-line:\n\nproject_root\n/libs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy jni libs\n\n\nCopy and overwrite all the folders from \nplugin/android/jni\n\nto your \nproject_root\n/jni/\n directory.\n\n\n\n\nNote: sdkbox link with \ngnustl\n by default, if your project link with \nc++static\n please replace the files in \nproject_root\n/jni/\nplugin_name\n/libs\n with files in \nproject_root\n/jni/\nplugin_name\n/libs_c++_static\n folder\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nAndroidManifest.xml\n\n\nInclude the following permissions above the \napplication tag\n:\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.INTERNET\n/\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\n /\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\ncom.android.vending.BILLING\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nAndroid.mk\n\n\nEdit \nproject_root\n/jni/Android.mk\n to:\n\n\nAdd additional requirements to \nLOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES\n:\n\n\nLOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES += PluginSoomlaGrow\nLOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES += sdkbox\n\n\n\n\nAdd a call to:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n\n\n\n\nbefore any \nimport-module\n statements.\n\n\nAdd additional \nimport-module\n statements at the end:\n\n\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginsoomlagrow)\n\n\n\n\nThis means that your ordering should look similar to this:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginsoomlagrow)\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n It is important to make sure these statements are above the existing \n$(call import-module,./prebuilt-mk)\n statement, if you are using the pre-built libraries.\n\n\nModify \nApplication.mk\n (Cocos2d-x v3.0 to v3.2 only)\n\n\nEdit \nproject_root\n/jni/Application.mk\n to make sure \nAPP_STL\n is defined\ncorrectly.

One way to find the location is to look in \nproj.android/project.properties\n. Example:\n  \nandroid.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java\n\n\nIn this case, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n should be located at:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to add the following imports:\n\n\n\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, modify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to edit the \nonCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)\n function to add a call to \nSDKBox.init(this);\n. The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to \nonLoadNativeLibraries();\n. Example:\n\n\n\n\nonLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code. There are a few rules here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has not been defined, \nadd it\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has been defined, add the calls to \nSDKBox\n in the \nsame\n existing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nProguard (release, optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file.

Example  LOCAL_SRC_FILES := hellocpp/main.cpp \\\n                ../../Classes/AppDelegate.cpp \\\n                ../../Classes/HelloWorldScene.cpp \\\n                                ../../Classes/NewSourceFile.cpp  Modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java    If you're using cocos2d-x from source, assuming you are in the  proj.android  directory,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  is located:  ../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/\nlib/Cocos2dxActivity.java    If you're using the prebuilt cocos2d-x libraries assuming you are in the  proj.android  directory,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  is located:  ./src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java    Note:  When using Cocos2d-x from source, different versions have  Cocos2dxActivity.java  in a different location. One way to find the location is to look in  proj.android/project.properties . Example:\n   android.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java  In this case,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  should be located at:  ../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java   Modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to add the following imports:   import android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;   Second, modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to edit the  onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)  function to add a call to  SDKBox.init(this); . The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to  onLoadNativeLibraries(); . Example:   onLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);    Last, we need to insert the proper  overrides  code. There are a few rules here.    If the method listed has not been defined,  add it .    If the method listed has been defined, add the calls to  SDKBox  in the  same  existing function.          @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }  Proguard (release, optional)   Edit  project.properties   to specify a  Proguard  configuration file. Example:   proguard.config=proguard.cfg   Edit the file you specified to include the following:   # If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following\n# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface\n# class:\n#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {\n#   public *;\n#}\n\n\n# cocos2d-x\n-keep public class org.cocos2dx.** { *; }\n-dontwarn org.cocos2dx.**\n-keep public class com.chukong.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.chukong.**\n\n# google play service\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.** { public *; }\n-dontwarn com.google.android.gms.**\n\n-keep class * extends java.util.ListResourceBundle {\n    protected Object[][] getContents();\n}\n\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.common.internal.safeparcel.SafeParcelable {\n    public static final *** NULL;\n}\n\n-keepnames @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName class *\n-keepclassmembernames class * {\n    @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName *;\n}\n\n-keepnames class * implements android.os.Parcelable {\n    public static final ** CREATOR;\n}\n\n#sdkbox\n-keep public class com.sdkbox.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.sdkbox.**\n\n#soomlagrow\n-keep public class com.jirbo.soomlagrow.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.jirbo.soomlagrow.**\n\n-keep public class com.soomla.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.soomla.**  Note:  Proguard only works with  Release  builds (i.e  cocos run -m release ) debug builds do not invoke Proguard rules.",

            "text": "GROW\n\n\nGROW is \nSOOMLA\n's flagship, community-driven, data network. Mobile game studios can take advantage of GROW's Analytics, Whales Reports and Insights in order to gain valuable knowledge about users' behavior in other games. Information about GROW can be found on the \nKnowledge Base\n.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\n\n\nCertain SDKBOX plugins do not work together. If you use \nGROW\n, then you cannot also use the \nAdColony\n and \nFyber\n services, in the same project.\n\n\n\n\nIntegration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you still didn't sign up on the GROW Dashboard, go ahead and do it \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen a terminal and use the following command to install GROW's SDKBOX plugin. Make sure you setup the SDKBOX installer correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbash\n  $ sdkbox import soomlagrow\n\n\nImportant Notice\n\n\nIf you upgraded to Xcode7 you need to perform the following steps to your project for plugin to function correctly.\n\n\nDisable App Transport Security\n\n\nAdding the following entry to the plist:\n\n\nkey\nNSAppTransportSecurity\n/key\n\n\ndict\n\n    \nkey\nNSAllowsArbitraryLoads\n/key\n\n    \ntrue/\n\n\n/dict\n\n\n\n\n\nDisable Bitcode support\n\n\nYou have to turn off \nBitcode\n support. If you don't cocos2d-x will fail to build.\n\n\nSet your game requires full screen\n\n\nIf your game doesn't support all screen orientations you will need to check \nRequires full screen\n in Xcode. If you do not, your app will fail Apple's submission process.\n\n\nWhitelist canOpenURL function\n\n\nThis depends on what plugins are in your project. You may need to add the required entry to the \ninfo.plist\n, under \nLSApplicationQueriesSchemes\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON Configuration\n\n\nSDKBOX Installer will automatically inject a sample configuration to your \nres/sdkbox_config.json\n, that you will have to modify before you use in your own app.\n\n\nHere is an example of the GROW configuration, you need to replace \ngameKey\n and \nenvkey\n items with the ones you were given by the \nGROW Dashboard\n. You will probably use the same \ngameKey\n and \nenvKey\n for Android and iOS but you will still need to specify it twice, once for each platform. Example:\n\n\nios\n :\n{\n  \nsoomlaGrow\n:{\n              \ngameKey\n:\n0cbc07e3-0f0c-4b68-bb0c-061c1b5fb553\n,\n              \nenvKey\n:\n8b865add-4541-4db1-be18-f6c7e5e00564\n\n          }\n}\n\nandroid\n :\n{\n  \nsoomlaGrow\n:{\n              \ngameKey\n:\n0cbc07e3-0f0c-4b68-bb0c-061c1b5fb553\n,\n              \nenvKey\n:\n8b865add-4541-4db1-be18-f6c7e5e00564\n\n          }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nRegister Javascript Functions\n\n\nYou need to register all the SOOMLA Grow JS functions with cocos2d-x before using them.\n\n\nTo do this:\n* Modify \n./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp\n to include the following headers:\n\n\n#include \nPluginSoomlaGrowJS.hpp\n\n#include \nPluginSoomlaGrowJSHelper.hpp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \n./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp\n make sure to call:\n\n\n\n\nsc-\naddRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginSoomlaGrowJS);\nsc-\naddRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginSoomlaGrowJS_helper);\n\n\n\n\nInitialize SoomlaGrow\n\n\nInitialize the plugin by calling \ninit()\n where appropriate in your code. We\nrecommend to do this in the \napp.js\n. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginSoomlaGrow.init();\n\n\n\n\nUsing GROW's Insights module\n\n\nAfter initialization you can begin to use the Insights functionality. Use \nrefreshInsight\n, 'getUserInsightInfo' wherever you want from your code:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginSoomlaGrow.refreshInsight()\nsdkbox.PluginSoomlaGrow.getUserInsightInfo()\n\n\n\n\nCatch SoomlaGrow events (optional)\n\n\nThis allows you to catch the \nSOOMLA Grow\n events so that you can perform operations based upon responses. A simple example might look like this:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginSoomlaGrow.setListener({\n            onHighWayInitialized: function(data) {cc.log(\nonHighWayInitialized\n)},\n            onHighWayConnected: function(data) { cc.log(\nonHighWayConnected\n) },\n            onHighWayDisconnected: function(data) { cc.log(\nonHighWayDisconnected\n) }\n            })\nsdkbox.PluginSoomlaGrow.init()\n\n\n\n\nAPI Reference\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginSoomlaGrow.init();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitialize the plugin instance.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginSoomlaGrow.setListener(listener);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet listener to listen to GROW events\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginSoomlaGrow.refreshInsight()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefreshed Insights information from the server\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginSoomlaGrow.getUserInsightInfo()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nget user insights info\n Note: the returned value may be empty\n\n\n\n\nListeners\n\n\nonHighWayInitialized()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis event is triggered once the highway initialized.\n\n\n\n\nonHighWayConnected()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis event is triggered once the highway is connected to server.\n\n\n\n\nonHighWayDisconnected()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis event is triggered once the highway disconnect from the server.\n\n\n\n\nManual Integration\n\n\nIf the \nSDKBOX Installer\n \nfails\n to complete successfully, it is possible to integrate SDKBOX manually. If the installer complete successfully, please \ndo not\n complete anymore of this document. It is not necessary.\n\n\nThese steps are listed last in this document on purpose as they are seldom needed. If you find yourself using these steps, please, after completing, double back and re-read the steps above for other integration items.\n\n\nManual Integration For iOS\n\n\nDrag and drop the following frameworks from the \nplugins/ios\n folder of the \nSOOMLA Grow\n bundle into your Xcode project, check \nCopy items if needed\n when adding frameworks:\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.framework\n\n\nPluginSoomlaGrow.framework\n\n\n\n\nThe above frameworks depend upon a large number of other frameworks. You also need to add the following system frameworks, if you don't already have them:\n\n\n\n\nSecurity.framework\n\n\nlibsqlite3.0.dylib\n\n\nStoreKit.framework\n\n\nCFNetwork.framework\n\n\nlibicucore.dylib\n\n\nSystemConfguration.framework\n\n\nAdSupport.framework\n\n\n\n\nCopy all source and header files from \nplugin/jsbindings/\n to your projects \nClasses\n folder.\n\n\nAdd these same files, that you just copied, to Xcode by either dragging and dropping them into Xcode or by using \nFile -\n Add files to...\n.\n\n\nManual Integration For Android\n\n\nSDKBOX supports three different kinds of \nAndroid\n projects \ncommand-line\n, \neclipse\n and \nAndroid Studio\n. \n\n\n\n\nproj.android\n will be used as our \nproject_root\n for \ncommand-line\n and \neclipse\n project\n\n\nproj.android-studio\n will be used as our \nproject_root\n for \nAndroid Studio\n project.\n\n\n\n\nCopy Files\n\n\nCopy the following \njar\n files from \nplugin/android/libs\n folder of this\nbundle into your project\u2019s \nproj.android/libs\n folder.\n\n\n\n\nSoomlaGrowLite.jar\n\n\nPluginSoomlaGrow.jar\n\n\nsdkbox.jar\n\n\n\n\nCopy jni libs\n\n\nCopy and overwrite all the folders from \nplugin/android/jni\n\nto your \nproject_root\n/jni/\n directory.\n\n\n\n\nNote: sdkbox link with \ngnustl\n by default, if your project link with \nc++static\n please replace the files in \nproject_root\n/jni/\nplugin_name\n/libs\n with files in \nproject_root\n/jni/\nplugin_name\n/libs_c++_static\n folder\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nAndroidManifest.xml\n\n\nInclude the following permissions above the \napplication tag\n:\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.INTERNET\n/\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\n /\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\ncom.android.vending.BILLING\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nAndroid.mk\n\n\nEdit \nproj.android/jni/Android.mk\n to:\n\n\nAdd additional requirements to \nLOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES\n:\n\n\nLOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES += android_native_app_glue\nLOCAL_LDLIBS += -landroid\nLOCAL_LDLIBS += -llog\nLOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES += PluginSoomlaGrow\nLOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES += sdkbox\n\n\n\n\nAdd a call to:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n\n\n\n\nbefore any \nimport-module\n statements.\n\n\nAdd additional \nimport-module\n statements at the end:\n\n\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginsoomlagrow)\n\n\n\n\nThis means that your ordering should look similar to this:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginsoomlagrow)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nAplication.mk\n\n\nEdit \nproj.android/jni/Application.mk\n to:\n\n\nAdd \nAPP_PATFORM\n version requirements:\n\n\nAPP_PLATFORM := android-9\n\n\n\n\nCopy all source and header files from \nplugin/jsbindings/\n to your projects \nClasses\n folder.\n\n\nAdd all \n.cpp\n files, that you just copied, to \nAndroid.mk\n in the \nLOCAL_SRC_FILES\n section.

You may need to add the required entry to the \ninfo.plist\n, under \nLSApplicationQueriesSchemes\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON Configuration\n\n\nSDKBOX Installer will automatically inject a sample configuration to your \nsdkbox_config.json\n, that you have to modify it before you can use it for your own app\n\n\nHere is an example of the Tune configuration, you need to replace\n\nTUNE ID\n and \nTUNE KEY\n  with your specific \nTune ID\n account information.\nHere is an example adding \nTune\n:\n\n\nTune\n:{\n    \nid\n:\nTUNE ID\n,\n    \nkey\n:\nTUNE KEY\n,\n    \ndebug\n:false\n}\n\n\n\n\nExtra steps\n\n\nSetup iOS\n\n\n\n\nApply the code change to \nAppController.mm\n instead of \nAppDelegate.cpp\n\n\n\n\n#import \nMobileAppTracker/MobileAppTracker.h\n\n\n- (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application\n{\n    // MAT will not function without the measureSession call included\n    [MobileAppTracker measureSession];\n}\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation\n{\n    [MobileAppTracker applicationDidOpenURL:[url absoluteString] sourceApplication:sourceApplication];\n\n    return YES;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nInitialize Tune\n\n\nInitialize the plugin where appropriate in your code. We recommend to do this in the \nAppDelegate::applicationDidFinishLaunching()\n or \nAppController:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions()\n. Make sure to include the appropriate headers. \ninit()\n and \nmeasureSession()\n are required. Example:\n\n\n#include \nPluginTune/PluginTune.h\n\nAppDelegate::applicationDidFinishLaunching()\n{\n     sdkbox::PluginTune::init();\n     sdkbox::PluginTune::measureSession();\n}\n\n\n\n\nUsing Tune\n\n\nAfter initialization you can begin to use the Tune functionality. Tune uses a concept of \nevents\n (also known as \nMAT Native Event Types\n). You log \nevents\n that you care about and you can later view them using the web-based report viewer. Tune provides a structure for these events in their documentation. Example:\n\n\n{\n    PluginTune::measureEventName(\npurchase\n);\n    PluginTune::measureEventId(1122334455);\n        TuneEvent event;\n    event.eventName = \npurchase2\n;\n    event.refId     = \nRJ1357\n;\n    event.searchString = \nsweet crisp red apples\n;\n    event.attribute1 = \ncrisp\n;\n    event.attribute2 = \nred\n;\n    event.quantity = 3;\n    PluginTune::measureEvent(event);\n}\n\n\n\n\nNotice that at the end of the \nevent\n \nPluginTune::measureEvent(event)\n was called. This takes care of logging our event.\n\n\nAPI Reference\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nstatic void setListener ( TuneListener * listener ) ;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nset a listener to listen for event changes.\n\n\n\n\nstatic TuneListener * getListener ( ) ;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the listener\n\n\n\n\nstatic void removeListener ( ) ;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nremove the listener, and can't listen to events anymore\n\n\n\n\nstatic void init ( ) ;\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninit the instance.\n\n\n\n\nstatic void setDebugMode ( bool enable ) ;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifies that the server responses should include debug information.\n\n\n\n\nstatic void setAllowDuplicateRequests ( bool allow ) ;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet to YES to allow duplicate requests to be registered with the MAT server.\n\n\n\n\nstatic void checkForDeferredDeeplinkWithTimeout ( double timeout ) ;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck for a deferred deeplink entry point upon app installation.\nThis is safe to call at every app launch, since the function does nothing\nunless this is the first launch.\n\n\n\n\nstatic void automateIapEventMeasurement ( bool automate ) ;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable automatic measurement of app store in-app-purchase events.

If \nApplication.mk\n contains \nAPP_STL := c++_static\n, it should be\nchanged to:\n\n\nAPP_STL := gnustl_static\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using cocos2d-x from source, assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/\nlib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using the prebuilt cocos2d-x libraries assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n./src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n When using Cocos2d-x from source, different versions have \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n in a different location. One way to find the location is to look in \nproj.android/project.properties\n. Example:\n  \nandroid.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java\n\n\nIn this case, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n should be located at:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to add the following imports:\n\n\n\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, modify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to edit the \nonCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)\n function to add a call to \nSDKBox.init(this);\n. The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to \nonLoadNativeLibraries();\n. Example:\n\n\n\n\nonLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code. There are a few rules here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has not been defined, \nadd it\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has been defined, add the calls to \nSDKBox\n in the \nsame\n existing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nProguard (optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file. Example:\n\n\n\n\nproguard.config=proguard.cfg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the file you specified to include the following:\n\n\n\n\n# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following\n# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface\n# class:\n#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {\n#   public *;\n#}\n\n# cocos2d-x\n-keep public class org.cocos2dx.** { *; }\n-dontwarn org.cocos2dx.**\n-keep public class com.chukong.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.chukong.**\n\n# google play service\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.** { public *; }\n-dontwarn com.google.android.gms.**\n\n-keep class * extends java.util.ListResourceBundle {\n    protected Object[][] getContents();\n}\n\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.common.internal.safeparcel.SafeParcelable {\n    public static final *** NULL;\n}\n\n-keepnames @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName class *\n-keepclassmembernames class * {\n    @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName *;\n}\n\n-keepnames class * implements android.os.Parcelable {\n    public static final ** CREATOR;\n}\n\n#sdkbox\n-keep public class com.sdkbox.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.sdkbox.**\n\n#tune\n-keep public class com.mobileapptracker.** {\n    public *;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Proguard only works with \nRelease\n builds (i.e \ncocos run -m release\n) debug builds do not invoke Proguard rules.\n\n\nModify \nproject.properties\n\n\nAn \nAndroid Library Reference\n for \nGoogle Play Services\n is required. The\npath will be different depending upon your setup. Also, this is an additional\ndownload that does not come as part of a standard install. To install use the\n\nsdk installer\n and choose \nextras-\ngoogle play services\n. Here is an example of what this line could look like:\n\n\nandroid.library.reference.1=\n../android/sdk.latest/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject/\ngoogle-play-services_lib\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n if you already have an \nandroid.library.reference.1\n you can add\nanother by incrementing the number as \nandroid.library.reference.2\n, etc.",

Tune uses a concept of  events  (also known as  MAT Native Event Types ). You log  events  that you care about and you can later view them using the web-based report viewer. Tune provides a structure for these events in their documentation.

Add additional  import-module  statements at the end:  $(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./plugintune)  This means that your ordering should look similar to this:  $(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./plugintune)  Note:  It is important to make sure these statements are above the existing  $(call import-module,./prebuilt-mk)  statement, if you are using the pre-built libraries.  Modify  Application.mk  (Cocos2d-x v3.0 to v3.2 only)  Edit  project_root /jni/Application.mk  to make sure  APP_STL  is defined\ncorrectly. If  Application.mk  contains  APP_STL := c++_static , it should be\nchanged to:  APP_STL := gnustl_static  Modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java    If you're using cocos2d-x from source, assuming you are in the  proj.android  directory,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  is located:  ../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/\nlib/Cocos2dxActivity.java    If you're using the prebuilt cocos2d-x libraries assuming you are in the  proj.android  directory,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  is located:  ./src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java    Note:  When using Cocos2d-x from source, different versions have  Cocos2dxActivity.java  in a different location. One way to find the location is to look in  proj.android/project.properties . Example:\n   android.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java  In this case,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  should be located at:  ../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java   Modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to add the following imports:   import android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;   Second, modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to edit the  onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)  function to add a call to  SDKBox.init(this); . The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to  onLoadNativeLibraries(); . Example:   onLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);    Last, we need to insert the proper  overrides  code. There are a few rules here.    If the method listed has not been defined,  add it .    If the method listed has been defined, add the calls to  SDKBox  in the  same  existing function.          @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }",

You may need to add the required entry to the \ninfo.plist\n, under \nLSApplicationQueriesSchemes\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON Configuration\n\n\nSDKBOX Installer will automatically inject a sample configuration to your \nsdkbox_config.json\n, that you have to modify it before you can use it for your own app\n\n\nHere is an example of the Tune configuration, you need to replace\n\nTUNE ID\n and \nTUNE KEY\n  with your specific \nTune ID\n account information.\nHere is an example adding \nTune\n:\n\n\nTune\n:{\n    \nid\n:\nTUNE ID\n,\n    \nkey\n:\nTUNE KEY\n,\n    \ndebug\n:false\n}\n\n\n\n\nExtra steps\n\n\nSetup iOS\n\n\n\n\nApply the code change to \nAppController.mm\n instead of \nAppDelegate.cpp\n\n\n\n\n#import \nMobileAppTracker/MobileAppTracker.h\n\n\n- (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application\n{\n    // MAT will not function without the measureSession call included\n    [MobileAppTracker measureSession];\n}\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation\n{\n    [MobileAppTracker applicationDidOpenURL:[url absoluteString] sourceApplication:sourceApplication];\n\n    return YES;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nRegister Javascript Functions\n\n\nYou need to register all the Tune JS functions with cocos2d-x before using them.\n\n\nTo do this:\n* Modify \n./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp\n to include the following headers:\n\n\n#include \nPluginTuneJS.hpp\n\n#include \nPluginTuneJSHelper.h\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \n./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp\n make sure to call:\n\n\n\n\nsc-\naddRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginTuneJS);\nsc-\naddRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginTuneJS_helper);\n\n\n\n\nInitialize Tune\n\n\nInitialize the plugin by calling \ninit()\n where appropriate in your code. We\nrecommend to do this in the \napp.js\n. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune.init();\n\n\n\n\nUsing Tune\n\n\nAfter initialization you can begin to use the Tune functionality. Tune uses a concept of \nevents\n (also known as \nMAT Native Event Types\n). You log \nevents\n that you care about and you can later view them using the web-based report viewer. Tune provides a structure for these events in their documentation. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune.measureEventName(\nlogin\n);\nsdkbox.PluginTune.measureEventId(0123456789);\n\nvar event = {};\nevent.eventName = \npurchase\n;\nevent.refId = \nRJ1357\n;\nevent.searchString = \nsweet srisp red apples\n;\nevent.attribute1 = \nsrisp\n;\nevent.attribute2 = \nred\n;\nevent.quantity = 3;\nsdkbox.PluginTune.measureEvent(JSON.stringify(event));\n\n\n\n\nCatch Tune events (optional)\n\n\nThis allows you to catch the \nTune\n events so that you can perform operations based upon responses. A simple example might look like this:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune.setListener({\n  onEnqueuedAction: function(data) {},\n  onSucceed: function(data) {},\n  onFailed: function(data) {},\n  onReceiveDeeplink: function(data, timeout) {},\n  onFailDeeplink: function(errorString) {}\n});\n\n\n\n\nAPI Reference\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune.setListener(listener);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nset a listener to listen for event changes.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune.init();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninit the instance.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune.setDebugMode(enable);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifies that the server responses should include debug information.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune.setAllowDuplicateRequests(allow);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet to YES to allow duplicate requests to be registered with the MAT server.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune.checkForDeferredDeeplinkWithTimeout(timeout);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck for a deferred deeplink entry point upon app installation.\nThis is safe to call at every app launch, since the function does nothing\nunless this is the first launch.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune.automateIapEventMeasurement(automate);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable automatic measurement of app store in-app-purchase events. When enabled, your code\nshould not explicitly measure events for successful purchases related to StoreKit to avoid event duplication.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune.setFacebookEventLogging(logging, limit);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet whether the MAT events should also be logged to the Facebook SDK. This flag is ignored\nif the Facebook SDK is not present.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune.setExistingUser(existingUser);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet whether this is an existing user or a new one.

To do this:\n* Modify  ./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp  to include the following headers:  #include  PluginTuneJS.hpp \n#include  PluginTuneJSHelper.h    Modify  ./frameworks/runtime-src/Classes/AppDelegate.cpp  make sure to call:   sc- addRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginTuneJS);\nsc- addRegisterCallback(register_all_PluginTuneJS_helper);  Initialize Tune  Initialize the plugin by calling  init()  where appropriate in your code. We\nrecommend to do this in the  app.js . Example:  sdkbox.PluginTune.init();  Using Tune  After initialization you can begin to use the Tune functionality. Tune uses a concept of  events  (also known as  MAT Native Event Types ). You log  events  that you care about and you can later view them using the web-based report viewer. Tune provides a structure for these events in their documentation. Example:  sdkbox.PluginTune.measureEventName( login );\nsdkbox.PluginTune.measureEventId(0123456789);\n\nvar event = {};\nevent.eventName =  purchase ;\nevent.refId =  RJ1357 ;\nevent.searchString =  sweet srisp red apples ;\nevent.attribute1 =  srisp ;\nevent.attribute2 =  red ;\nevent.quantity = 3;\nsdkbox.PluginTune.measureEvent(JSON.stringify(event));  Catch Tune events (optional)  This allows you to catch the  Tune  events so that you can perform operations based upon responses. A simple example might look like this:  sdkbox.PluginTune.setListener({\n  onEnqueuedAction: function(data) {},\n  onSucceed: function(data) {},\n  onFailed: function(data) {},\n  onReceiveDeeplink: function(data, timeout) {},\n  onFailDeeplink: function(errorString) {}\n});",

This can be done anyplace, however it must be done before trying to use the plugin's features.\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune:init()\n\n\n\n\nUsing Tune\n\n\nAfter initialization you can begin to use the Tune functionality. Tune uses a concept of \nevents\n (also known as \nMAT Native Event Types\n). You log \nevents\n that you care about and you can later view them using the web-based report viewer. Tune provides a structure for these events in their documentation. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune:measureEventName(\nlogin\n)\nsdkbox.PluginTune:measureEventId(0123456789)\n\nlocal event = {}\nevent.eventName = \npurchase\n\nevent.refId = \nRJ1357\n\nevent.searchString = \nsweet srisp red apples\n\nevent.attribute1 = \nsrisp\n\nevent.attribute2 = \nred\n\nevent.quantity = 3\nsdkbox.PluginTune:measureEventForScript(json.encode(event))\n\n\n\n\nCatch Tune events (optional)\n\n\nThis allows you to catch the \nTune\n events so that you can perform operations based upon responses. A simple example might look like this:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune:setListener(function(eventName, eventData, timeout)\n        -- the third param \ntimeout\n valid, when eventName equal \nonReceiveDeeplink\n\n        print(eventName, eventData)\n    end)\n\n\n\n\nAPI Reference\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune:setListener(listener)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nset a listener to listen for event changes.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune:init()\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninit the instance.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune:setDebugMode(enable)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifies that the server responses should include debug information.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune:setAllowDuplicateRequests(allow)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet to YES to allow duplicate requests to be registered with the MAT server.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune:checkForDeferredDeeplinkWithTimeout(timeout)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck for a deferred deeplink entry point upon app installation.\nThis is safe to call at every app launch, since the function does nothing\nunless this is the first launch.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune:automateIapEventMeasurement(automate)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable automatic measurement of app store in-app-purchase events. When enabled, your code\nshould not explicitly measure events for successful purchases related to StoreKit to avoid event duplication.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune:setFacebookEventLogging(logging, limit)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet whether the MAT events should also be logged to the Facebook SDK. This flag is ignored\nif the Facebook SDK is not present.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune:setExistingUser(existingUser)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet whether this is an existing user or a new one.

This can be done anyplace, however it must be done before trying to use the plugin's features.  sdkbox.PluginTune:init()  Using Tune  After initialization you can begin to use the Tune functionality. Tune uses a concept of  events  (also known as  MAT Native Event Types ). You log  events  that you care about and you can later view them using the web-based report viewer. Tune provides a structure for these events in their documentation. Example:  sdkbox.PluginTune:measureEventName( login )\nsdkbox.PluginTune:measureEventId(0123456789)\n\nlocal event = {}\nevent.eventName =  purchase \nevent.refId =  RJ1357 \nevent.searchString =  sweet srisp red apples \nevent.attribute1 =  srisp \nevent.attribute2 =  red \nevent.quantity = 3\nsdkbox.PluginTune:measureEventForScript(json.encode(event))  Catch Tune events (optional)  This allows you to catch the  Tune  events so that you can perform operations based upon responses. A simple example might look like this:  sdkbox.PluginTune:setListener(function(eventName, eventData, timeout)\n        -- the third param  timeout  valid, when eventName equal  onReceiveDeeplink \n        print(eventName, eventData)\n    end)",

You may need to add the required entry to the \ninfo.plist\n, under \nLSApplicationQueriesSchemes\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON Configuration\n\n\nSDKBOX Installer will automatically inject a sample configuration to your \nsdkbox_config.json\n, that you have to modify it before you can use it for your own app\n\n\nHere is an example of the Tune configuration, you need to replace\n\nTUNE ID\n and \nTUNE KEY\n  with your specific \nTune ID\n account information.\nHere is an example adding \nTune\n:\n\n\nTune\n:{\n    \nid\n:\nTUNE ID\n,\n    \nkey\n:\nTUNE KEY\n,\n    \ndebug\n:false\n}\n\n\n\n\nExtra steps\n\n\nSetup iOS\n\n\n\n\nApply the code change to \nAppController.mm\n instead of \nAppDelegate.cpp\n\n\n\n\n#import \nMobileAppTracker/MobileAppTracker.h\n\n\n- (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application\n{\n    // MAT will not function without the measureSession call included\n    [MobileAppTracker measureSession];\n}\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation\n{\n    [MobileAppTracker applicationDidOpenURL:[url absoluteString] sourceApplication:sourceApplication];\n\n    return YES;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nInitialize Tune\n\n\nInitialize the plugin where appropriate in your code. We recommend to do this in the \nAppDelegate::applicationDidFinishLaunching()\n or \nAppController:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions()\n. Make sure to include the appropriate headers. \ninit()\n and \nmeasureSession()\n are required. Example:\n\n\n#include \nPluginTune/PluginTune.h\n\nAppDelegate::applicationDidFinishLaunching()\n{\n     sdkbox::PluginTune::init();\n     sdkbox::PluginTune::measureSession();\n}\n\n\n\n\nUsing Tune\n\n\nAfter initialization you can begin to use the Tune functionality. Tune uses a concept of \nevents\n (also known as \nMAT Native Event Types\n). You log \nevents\n that you care about and you can later view them using the web-based report viewer. Tune provides a structure for these events in their documentation. Example:\n\n\n{\n    PluginTune::measureEventName(\npurchase\n);\n    PluginTune::measureEventId(1122334455);\n        TuneEvent event;\n    event.eventName = \npurchase2\n;\n    event.refId     = \nRJ1357\n;\n    event.searchString = \nsweet crisp red apples\n;\n    event.attribute1 = \ncrisp\n;\n    event.attribute2 = \nred\n;\n    event.quantity = 3;\n    PluginTune::measureEvent(event);\n}\n\n\n\n\nNotice that at the end of the \nevent\n \nPluginTune::measureEvent(event)\n was called. This takes care of logging our event.\n\n\nAPI Reference\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nstatic void setListener ( TuneListener * listener ) ;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nset a listener to listen for event changes.\n\n\n\n\nstatic TuneListener * getListener ( ) ;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the listener\n\n\n\n\nstatic void removeListener ( ) ;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nremove the listener, and can't listen to events anymore\n\n\n\n\nstatic void init ( ) ;\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninit the instance.\n\n\n\n\nstatic void setDebugMode ( bool enable ) ;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifies that the server responses should include debug information.\n\n\n\n\nstatic void setAllowDuplicateRequests ( bool allow ) ;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet to YES to allow duplicate requests to be registered with the MAT server.\n\n\n\n\nstatic void checkForDeferredDeeplinkWithTimeout ( double timeout ) ;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck for a deferred deeplink entry point upon app installation.\nThis is safe to call at every app launch, since the function does nothing\nunless this is the first launch.\n\n\n\n\nstatic void automateIapEventMeasurement ( bool automate ) ;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable automatic measurement of app store in-app-purchase events.

We\nrecommend to do this in the \napp.js\n. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune.init();\n\n\n\n\nUsing Tune\n\n\nAfter initialization you can begin to use the Tune functionality. Tune uses a concept of \nevents\n (also known as \nMAT Native Event Types\n). You log \nevents\n that you care about and you can later view them using the web-based report viewer. Tune provides a structure for these events in their documentation. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune.measureEventName(\nlogin\n);\nsdkbox.PluginTune.measureEventId(0123456789);\n\nvar event = {};\nevent.eventName = \npurchase\n;\nevent.refId = \nRJ1357\n;\nevent.searchString = \nsweet srisp red apples\n;\nevent.attribute1 = \nsrisp\n;\nevent.attribute2 = \nred\n;\nevent.quantity = 3;\nsdkbox.PluginTune.measureEvent(JSON.stringify(event));\n\n\n\n\nCatch Tune events (optional)\n\n\nThis allows you to catch the \nTune\n events so that you can perform operations based upon responses. A simple example might look like this:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune.setListener({\n  onEnqueuedAction: function(data) {},\n  onSucceed: function(data) {},\n  onFailed: function(data) {},\n  onReceiveDeeplink: function(data, timeout) {},\n  onFailDeeplink: function(errorString) {}\n});\n\n\n\n\nAPI Reference\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune.setListener(listener);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nset a listener to listen for event changes.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune.init();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninit the instance.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune.setDebugMode(enable);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifies that the server responses should include debug information.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune.setAllowDuplicateRequests(allow);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet to YES to allow duplicate requests to be registered with the MAT server.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune.checkForDeferredDeeplinkWithTimeout(timeout);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck for a deferred deeplink entry point upon app installation.\nThis is safe to call at every app launch, since the function does nothing\nunless this is the first launch.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune.automateIapEventMeasurement(automate);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable automatic measurement of app store in-app-purchase events.

Example of what this might look like for you:\n\n\n\n\nprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState){\n  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n  SDKBox.init(this);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code. There are a few rules here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has not been defined, \nadd it\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has been defined, add the calls to \nSDKBox\n in the \nsame\n existing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nProguard (optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file. Example:\n\n\n\n\nproguard.config=proguard.cfg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the file you specified to include the following:\n\n\n\n\n# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following\n# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface\n# class:\n#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {\n#   public *;\n#}\n\n# cocos2d-x\n-keep public class org.cocos2dx.** { *; }\n-dontwarn org.cocos2dx.**\n-keep public class com.chukong.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.chukong.**\n\n# google play service\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.** { public *; }\n-dontwarn com.google.android.gms.**\n\n-keep class * extends java.util.ListResourceBundle {\n    protected Object[][] getContents();\n}\n\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.common.internal.safeparcel.SafeParcelable {\n    public static final *** NULL;\n}\n\n-keepnames @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName class *\n-keepclassmembernames class * {\n    @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName *;\n}\n\n-keepnames class * implements android.os.Parcelable {\n    public static final ** CREATOR;\n}\n\n#sdkbox\n-keep public class com.sdkbox.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.sdkbox.**\n\n#tune\n-keep public class com.mobileapptracker.** {\n    public *;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Proguard only works with \nRelease\n builds (i.e \ncocos run -m release\n) debug builds do not invoke Proguard rules.\n\n\nModify \nproject.properties\n\n\nAn \nAndroid Library Reference\n for \nGoogle Play Services\n is required. The\npath will be different depending upon your setup. Also, this is an additional\ndownload that does not come as part of a standard install. To install use the\n\nsdk installer\n and choose \nextras-\ngoogle play services\n.

We\nrecommend to do this in the  app.js . Example:  sdkbox.PluginTune.init();  Using Tune  After initialization you can begin to use the Tune functionality. Tune uses a concept of  events  (also known as  MAT Native Event Types ). You log  events  that you care about and you can later view them using the web-based report viewer. Tune provides a structure for these events in their documentation. Example:  sdkbox.PluginTune.measureEventName( login );\nsdkbox.PluginTune.measureEventId(0123456789);\n\nvar event = {};\nevent.eventName =  purchase ;\nevent.refId =  RJ1357 ;\nevent.searchString =  sweet srisp red apples ;\nevent.attribute1 =  srisp ;\nevent.attribute2 =  red ;\nevent.quantity = 3;\nsdkbox.PluginTune.measureEvent(JSON.stringify(event));  Catch Tune events (optional)  This allows you to catch the  Tune  events so that you can perform operations based upon responses.

Tune uses a concept of \nevents\n (also known as \nMAT Native Event Types\n). You log \nevents\n that you care about and you can later view them using the web-based report viewer. Tune provides a structure for these events in their documentation. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune:measureEventName(\nlogin\n)\nsdkbox.PluginTune:measureEventId(0123456789)\n\nlocal event = {}\nevent.eventName = \npurchase\n\nevent.refId = \nRJ1357\n\nevent.searchString = \nsweet srisp red apples\n\nevent.attribute1 = \nsrisp\n\nevent.attribute2 = \nred\n\nevent.quantity = 3\nsdkbox.PluginTune:measureEventForScript(json.encode(event))\n\n\n\n\nCatch Tune events (optional)\n\n\nThis allows you to catch the \nTune\n events so that you can perform operations based upon responses. A simple example might look like this:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune:setListener(function(eventName, eventData, timeout)\n        -- the third param \ntimeout\n valid, when eventName equal \nonReceiveDeeplink\n\n        print(eventName, eventData)\n    end)\n\n\n\n\nAPI Reference\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune:setListener(listener)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nset a listener to listen for event changes.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune:init()\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninit the instance.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune:setDebugMode(enable)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifies that the server responses should include debug information.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune:setAllowDuplicateRequests(allow)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet to YES to allow duplicate requests to be registered with the MAT server.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune:checkForDeferredDeeplinkWithTimeout(timeout)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck for a deferred deeplink entry point upon app installation.\nThis is safe to call at every app launch, since the function does nothing\nunless this is the first launch.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginTune:automateIapEventMeasurement(automate)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable automatic measurement of app store in-app-purchase events.

This can be done anyplace, however it must be done before trying to use the plugin's features.  sdkbox.PluginTune:init()  Using Tune  After initialization you can begin to use the Tune functionality. Tune uses a concept of  events  (also known as  MAT Native Event Types ). You log  events  that you care about and you can later view them using the web-based report viewer. Tune provides a structure for these events in their documentation. Example:  sdkbox.PluginTune:measureEventName( login )\nsdkbox.PluginTune:measureEventId(0123456789)\n\nlocal event = {}\nevent.eventName =  purchase \nevent.refId =  RJ1357 \nevent.searchString =  sweet srisp red apples \nevent.attribute1 =  srisp \nevent.attribute2 =  red \nevent.quantity = 3\nsdkbox.PluginTune:measureEventForScript(json.encode(event))  Catch Tune events (optional)  This allows you to catch the  Tune  events so that you can perform operations based upon responses.

If you find yourself using these steps, please, after completing, double back and re-read the steps above for other integration items.\n\n\nManual Integration For iOS\n\n\nDrag and drop the following frameworks from the \nplugins/ios\n folder of the \nValuePotion\n bundle into your Xcode project, check \nCopy items if needed\n when adding frameworks:\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.framework\n\n\nPluginValuePotion.framework\n\n\n\n\nThe above frameworks depend upon other frameworks. You also need to add the following system frameworks, if you don't already have them:\n\n\n\n\nUIKit.framework\n\n\nFoundation.framework\n\n\nCoreGraphics.framework\n\n\nSystemConfiguration.framework\n\n\nCoreTelephony.framework\n\n\nAdSupport.framework\n\n\n\n\nManual Integration For Android\n\n\nSDKBOX supports three different kinds of \nAndroid\n projects \ncommand-line\n, \neclipse\n and \nAndroid Studio\n. \n\n\n\n\nproj.android\n will be used as our \nproject_root\n for \ncommand-line\n and \neclipse\n project\n\n\nproj.android-studio\n will be used as our \nproject_root\n for \nAndroid Studio\n project.\n\n\n\n\nCopy Files\n\n\nCopy the following \njar\n files from \nplugin/android/libs\n folder of this\nbundle into your project\u2019s \n/libs\n folder.\n\n\n\n\nvaluepotion.jar\n\n\nPluginValuePotion.jar\n\n\nsdkbox.jar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using cocos2d-x from source copy the \njar\n files to:\n\n\nAndroid command-line:\n\ncocos2d/cocos/platform/android/java/libs\n\n\nAndroid Studio:\n\ncocos2d/cocos/platform/android/libcocos2dx/libs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using cocos2d-js or lua copy the \njar\n files to:\n\n\nAndroid command-line:\n\nframeworks/cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/libs\n\n\nAndroid Studio:\n\nframeworks/cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/libcocos2dx/libs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using prebuilt cocos2d-x copy the \njar\n files to:\n\n\nAndroid command-line:\n\nproj.android/libs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy jni libs\n\n\nCopy and overwrite all the folders from \nplugin/android/jni\n\nto your \nproject_root\n/jni/\n directory.\n\n\n\n\nNote: sdkbox link with \ngnustl\n by default, if your project link with \nc++static\n please replace the files in \nproject_root\n/jni/\nplugin_name\n/libs\n with files in \nproject_root\n/jni/\nplugin_name\n/libs_c++_static\n folder\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nAndroidManifest.xml\n\n\nInclude the following permissions above the \napplication tag\n:\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.INTERNET\n /\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\n /\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE\n /\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE\n /\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\n /\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\n /\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are also a few necessary tags that also need to be added:\n\n\napplication\n\n\n......\n\n\nmeta-data android:name=\ncom.google.android.gms.version\n\n            android:value=\n@integer/google_play_services_version\n /\n\n\n\n!-- Valuepotion Components --\n\n\n!-- for interstital ad interface --\n\n\nactivity\n        android:name=\ncom.valuepotion.sdk.VPInterstitialActivity\n\n        android:theme=\n@android:style/Theme.Translucent\n \n\n\n/activity\n\n\n\n!-- for CPI tracking --\n\n\nreceiver\n        android:name=\ncom.valuepotion.sdk.VPInstallReceiver\n\n        android:exported=\ntrue\n \n\n        \nintent-filter\n\n                \naction android:name=\ncom.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER\n /\n\n        \n/intent-filter\n\n\n/receiver\n\n\n!-- Valuepotion Components End --\n\n\n.....\n\n\n/application\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nAndroid.mk\n\n\nEdit \nproject_root\n/jni/Android.mk\n to:\n\n\nAdd additional requirements to \nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES\n:\n\n\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += PluginValuePotion\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += sdkbox\n\n\n\n\nAdd a call to:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n\n\n\n\nbefore any \nimport-module\n statements.\n\n\nAdd additional \nimport-module\n statements at the end:\n\n\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginvaluepotion)\n\n\n\n\nThis means that your ordering should look similar to this:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginvaluepotion)\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n It is important to make sure these statements are above the existing \n$(call import-module,./prebuilt-mk)\n statement, if you are using the pre-built libraries.\n\n\nModify \nApplication.mk\n (Cocos2d-x v3.0 to v3.2 only)\n\n\nEdit \nproject_root\n/jni/Application.mk\n to make sure \nAPP_STL\n is defined\ncorrectly. If \nApplication.mk\n contains \nAPP_STL := c++_static\n, it should be\nchanged to:\n\n\nAPP_STL := gnustl_static\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using cocos2d-x from source, assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/\nlib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using the prebuilt cocos2d-x libraries assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n./src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n When using Cocos2d-x from source, different versions have \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n in a different location. One way to find the location is to look in \nproj.android/project.properties\n. Example:\n  \nandroid.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java\n\n\nIn this case, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n should be located at:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to add the following imports:\n\n\n\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, modify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to edit the \nonCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)\n function to add a call to \nSDKBox.init(this);\n. The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to \nonLoadNativeLibraries();\n. Example:\n\n\n\n\nonLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code. There are a few rules here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has not been defined, \nadd it\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has been defined, add the calls to \nSDKBox\n in the \nsame\n existing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nProguard (optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file. Example:\n\n\n\n\nproguard.config=proguard.cfg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the file you specified to include the following:\n\n\n\n\n# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following\n# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface\n# class:\n#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {\n#   public *;\n#}\n\n# cocos2d-x\n-keep public class org.cocos2dx.** { *; }\n-dontwarn org.cocos2dx.**\n-keep public class com.chukong.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.chukong.**\n\n# google play service\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.** { public *; }\n-dontwarn com.google.android.gms.**\n\n-keep class * extends java.util.ListResourceBundle {\n    protected Object[][] getContents();\n}\n\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.common.internal.safeparcel.SafeParcelable {\n    public static final *** NULL;\n}\n\n-keepnames @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName class *\n-keepclassmembernames class * {\n    @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName *;\n}\n\n-keepnames class * implements android.os.Parcelable {\n    public static final ** CREATOR;\n}\n\n#sdkbox\n-keep public class com.sdkbox.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.sdkbox.**\n\n# vungle\n-keep public class com.valuepotion.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.valuepotion.**\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Proguard only works with \nRelease\n builds (i.e \ncocos run -m release\n) debug builds do not invoke Proguard rules.",

If \nApplication.mk\n contains \nAPP_STL := c++_static\n, it should be\nchanged to:\n\n\nAPP_STL := gnustl_static\n\n\n\n\nCopy all source and header files from \nplugin/jsbindings/\n to your projects \nClasses\n folder.\n\n\nAdd all \n.cpp\n files, that you just copied, to \nAndroid.mk\n in the \nLOCAL_SRC_FILES\n section. Example\n\n\nLOCAL_SRC_FILES := hellocpp/main.cpp \\\n                  ../../Classes/AppDelegate.cpp \\\n                  ../../Classes/HelloWorldScene.cpp \\\n                                    ../../Classes/NewSourceFile.cpp\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using cocos2d-x from source, assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/\nlib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using the prebuilt cocos2d-x libraries assuming you are in the \nproj.android\n directory, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n is located:\n\n\n./src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n When using Cocos2d-x from source, different versions have \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n in a different location. One way to find the location is to look in \nproj.android/project.properties\n. Example:\n  \nandroid.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java\n\n\nIn this case, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n should be located at:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to add the following imports:\n\n\n\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, modify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to edit the \nonCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)\n function to add a call to \nSDKBox.init(this);\n. The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to \nonLoadNativeLibraries();\n. Example:\n\n\n\n\nonLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code. There are a few rules here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has not been defined, \nadd it\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has been defined, add the calls to \nSDKBox\n in the \nsame\n existing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nProguard (optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file. Example:\n\n\n\n\nproguard.config=proguard.cfg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the file you specified to include the following:\n\n\n\n\n# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following\n# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface\n# class:\n#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {\n#   public *;\n#}\n\n# cocos2d-x\n-keep public class org.cocos2dx.** { *; }\n-dontwarn org.cocos2dx.**\n-keep public class com.chukong.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.chukong.**\n\n# google play service\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.** { public *; }\n-dontwarn com.google.android.gms.**\n\n-keep class * extends java.util.ListResourceBundle {\n    protected Object[][] getContents();\n}\n\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.common.internal.safeparcel.SafeParcelable {\n    public static final *** NULL;\n}\n\n-keepnames @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName class *\n-keepclassmembernames class * {\n    @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName *;\n}\n\n-keepnames class * implements android.os.Parcelable {\n    public static final ** CREATOR;\n}\n\n#sdkbox\n-keep public class com.sdkbox.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.sdkbox.**\n\n# vungle\n-keep public class com.valuepotion.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.valuepotion.**\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Proguard only works with \nRelease\n builds (i.e \ncocos run -m release\n) debug builds do not invoke Proguard rules.",

Add additional  import-module  statements at the end:  $(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginvaluepotion)  This means that your ordering should look similar to this:  $(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginvaluepotion)  Note:  It is important to make sure these statements are above the existing  $(call import-module,./prebuilt-mk)  statement, if you are using the pre-built libraries.  Modify  Application.mk  (Cocos2d-x v3.0 to v3.2 only)  Edit  project_root /jni/Application.mk  to make sure  APP_STL  is defined\ncorrectly. If  Application.mk  contains  APP_STL := c++_static , it should be\nchanged to:  APP_STL := gnustl_static  Copy all source and header files from  plugin/jsbindings/  to your projects  Classes  folder.

One way to find the location is to look in  proj.android/project.properties . Example:\n   android.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java  In this case,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  should be located at:  ../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java   Modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to add the following imports:   import android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;   Second, modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to edit the  onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)  function to add a call to  SDKBox.init(this); . The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to  onLoadNativeLibraries(); . Example:   onLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);    Last, we need to insert the proper  overrides  code. There are a few rules here.    If the method listed has not been defined,  add it .

One way to find the location is to look in \nproj.android/project.properties\n. Example:\n  \nandroid.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java\n\n\nIn this case, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n should be located at:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to add the following imports:\n\n\n\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, modify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to edit the \nonCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)\n function to add a call to \nSDKBox.init(this);\n. The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to \nonLoadNativeLibraries();\n. Example:\n\n\n\n\nonLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code. There are a few rules here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has not been defined, \nadd it\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has been defined, add the calls to \nSDKBox\n in the \nsame\n existing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nProguard (optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file. Example:\n\n\n\n\nproguard.config=proguard.cfg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the file you specified to include the following:\n\n\n\n\n# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following\n# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface\n# class:\n#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {\n#   public *;\n#}\n\n# cocos2d-x\n-keep public class org.cocos2dx.** { *; }\n-dontwarn org.cocos2dx.**\n-keep public class com.chukong.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.chukong.**\n\n# google play service\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.** { public *; }\n-dontwarn com.google.android.gms.**\n\n-keep class * extends java.util.ListResourceBundle {\n    protected Object[][] getContents();\n}\n\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.common.internal.safeparcel.SafeParcelable {\n    public static final *** NULL;\n}\n\n-keepnames @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName class *\n-keepclassmembernames class * {\n    @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName *;\n}\n\n-keepnames class * implements android.os.Parcelable {\n    public static final ** CREATOR;\n}\n\n#sdkbox\n-keep public class com.sdkbox.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.sdkbox.**\n\n# vungle\n-keep public class com.valuepotion.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.valuepotion.**\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Proguard only works with \nRelease\n builds (i.e \ncocos run -m release\n) debug builds do not invoke Proguard rules.",

One way to find the location is to look in  proj.android/project.properties . Example:\n   android.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java  In this case,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  should be located at:  ../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java   Modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to add the following imports:   import android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;   Second, modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to edit the  onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)  function to add a call to  SDKBox.init(this); . The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to  onLoadNativeLibraries(); . Example:   onLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);    Last, we need to insert the proper  overrides  code. There are a few rules here.    If the method listed has not been defined,  add it .    If the method listed has been defined, add the calls to  SDKBox  in the  same  existing function.          @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }",

If you find yourself using these steps, please, after completing, double back and re-read the steps above for other integration items.\n\n\nManual Integration For iOS\n\n\nDrag and drop the following frameworks from the \nplugins/ios\n folder of the \nValuePotion\n bundle into your Xcode project, check \nCopy items if needed\n when adding frameworks:\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.framework\n\n\nPluginValuePotion.framework\n\n\n\n\nThe above frameworks depend upon other frameworks. You also need to add the following system frameworks, if you don't already have them:\n\n\n\n\nUIKit.framework\n\n\nFoundation.framework\n\n\nCoreGraphics.framework\n\n\nSystemConfiguration.framework\n\n\nCoreTelephony.framework\n\n\nAdSupport.framework\n\n\n\n\nCopy all source and header files from \nplugin/jsbindings/\n to your projects \nClasses\n folder.\n\n\nAdd these same files, that you just copied, to Xcode by either dragging and dropping them into Xcode or by using \nFile -\n Add files to...\n.\n\n\nManual Integration For Android\n\n\nSDKBOX supports three different kinds of \nAndroid\n projects \ncommand-line\n, \neclipse\n and \nAndroid Studio\n. \n\n\n\n\nproj.android\n will be used as our \nproject_root\n for \ncommand-line\n and \neclipse\n project\n\n\nproj.android-studio\n will be used as our \nproject_root\n for \nAndroid Studio\n project.\n\n\n\n\nCopy Files\n\n\nCopy the following \njar\n files from \nplugin/android/libs\n folder of this\nbundle into your project\u2019s \nproj.android/libs\n folder.\n\n\n\n\nvaluepotion.jar\n\n\nPluginValuePotion.jar\n\n\nsdkbox.jar\n\n\n\n\nCopy jni libs\n\n\nCopy and overwrite all the folders from \nplugin/android/jni\n\nto your \nproject_root\n/jni/\n directory.\n\n\n\n\nNote: sdkbox link with \ngnustl\n by default, if your project link with \nc++static\n please replace the files in \nproject_root\n/jni/\nplugin_name\n/libs\n with files in \nproject_root\n/jni/\nplugin_name\n/libs_c++_static\n folder\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nAndroidManifest.xml\n\n\nInclude the following permissions above the \napplication tag\n:\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.INTERNET\n /\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\n /\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE\n /\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE\n /\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\n /\n\n\nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\n /\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are also a few necessary tags that also need to be added:\n\n\napplication\n\n\n......\n\n\nmeta-data android:name=\ncom.google.android.gms.version\n\n            android:value=\n@integer/google_play_services_version\n /\n\n\n\n!-- Valuepotion Components --\n\n\n!-- for interstital ad interface --\n\n\nactivity\n        android:name=\ncom.valuepotion.sdk.VPInterstitialActivity\n\n        android:theme=\n@android:style/Theme.Translucent\n \n\n\n/activity\n\n\n\n!-- for CPI tracking --\n\n\nreceiver\n        android:name=\ncom.valuepotion.sdk.VPInstallReceiver\n\n        android:exported=\ntrue\n \n\n        \nintent-filter\n\n                \naction android:name=\ncom.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER\n /\n\n        \n/intent-filter\n\n\n/receiver\n\n\n!-- Valuepotion Components End --\n\n\n.....\n\n\n/application\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nAndroid.mk\n\n\nEdit \nproj.android/jni/Android.mk\n to:\n\n\nAdd additional requirements to \nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES\n:\n\n\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += android_native_app_glue\nLOCAL_LDLIBS += -landroid\nLOCAL_LDLIBS += -llog\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += PluginValuePotion\nLOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += sdkbox\n\n\n\n\nAdd a call to:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n\n\n\n\nbefore any \nimport-module\n statements.\n\n\nAdd additional \nimport-module\n statements at the end:\n\n\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginvaluepotion)\n\n\n\n\nThis means that your ordering should look similar to this:\n\n\n$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginvaluepotion)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nAplication.mk\n\n\nEdit \nproj.android/jni/Application.mk\n to:\n\n\nAdd \nAPP_PATFORM\n version requirements:\n\n\nAPP_PLATFORM := android-9\n\n\n\n\nCopy all source and header files from \nplugin/jsbindings/\n to your projects \nClasses\n folder.\n\n\nAdd all \n.cpp\n files, that you just copied, to \nAndroid.mk\n in the \nLOCAL_SRC_FILES\n section.

Example of what this might look like for you:\n\n\n\n\nprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState){\n  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n  SDKBox.init(this);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we need to insert the proper \noverrides\n code. There are a few rules here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has not been defined, \nadd it\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the method listed has been defined, add the calls to \nSDKBox\n in the \nsame\n existing function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nProguard (optional)\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nproject.properties\n  to specify a \nProguard\n configuration file. Example:\n\n\n\n\nproguard.config=proguard.cfg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the file you specified to include the following:\n\n\n\n\n# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following\n# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface\n# class:\n#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {\n#   public *;\n#}\n\n# cocos2d-x\n-keep public class org.cocos2dx.** { *; }\n-dontwarn org.cocos2dx.**\n-keep public class com.chukong.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.chukong.**\n\n# google play service\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.** { public *; }\n-dontwarn com.google.android.gms.**\n\n-keep class * extends java.util.ListResourceBundle {\n    protected Object[][] getContents();\n}\n\n-keep public class com.google.android.gms.common.internal.safeparcel.SafeParcelable {\n    public static final *** NULL;\n}\n\n-keepnames @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName class *\n-keepclassmembernames class * {\n    @com.google.android.gms.common.annotation.KeepName *;\n}\n\n-keepnames class * implements android.os.Parcelable {\n    public static final ** CREATOR;\n}\n\n#sdkbox\n-keep public class com.sdkbox.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.sdkbox.**\n\n# vungle\n-keep public class com.valuepotion.** { *; }\n-dontwarn com.valuepotion.**\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Proguard only works with \nRelease\n builds (i.e \ncocos run -m release\n) debug builds do not invoke Proguard rules.",

Add additional  import-module  statements at the end:  $(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginvungle)  This means that your ordering should look similar to this:  $(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))\n$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)\n$(call import-module, ./pluginvungle)  Note:  It is important to make sure these statements are above the existing  $(call import-module,./prebuilt-mk)  statement, if you are using the pre-built libraries.  Modify  Application.mk  (Cocos2d-x v3.0 to v3.2 only)  Edit  project_root /jni/Application.mk  to make sure  APP_STL  is defined\ncorrectly.

One way to find the location is to look in  proj.android/project.properties . Example:\n   android.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java  In this case,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  should be located at:  ../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java   Modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to add the following imports:   import android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;   Second, modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to edit the  onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)  function to add a call to  SDKBox.init(this); . The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to  onLoadNativeLibraries(); . Example:   onLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);    Last, we need to insert the proper  overrides  code. There are a few rules here.    If the method listed has not been defined,  add it .

We\nrecommend to do this in the \napp.js\n. Example:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginVungle.init();\n\n\n\n\nShowing Ads\n\n\nDisplay an ad where ever you want from your code, either \nvideo\n or \nreward\n:\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginVungle.show(\nvideo\n);\nsdkbox.PluginVungle.show(\nreward\n);\n\n\n\n\nCatch Vungle events (optional)\n\n\nThis allows you to catch the \nVungle\n events so that you can perform operations such as providing player rewards for watching the video.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a listener (demonstrated by logging events):\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginVungle.setListener({\n    onVungleCacheAvailable : function() { cc.log(\nonVungleCacheAvailable\n) },\n    onVungleStarted : function() { cc.log(\nonVungleStarted\n) },\n    onVungleFinished : function() { cc.log(\nonVungleFinished\n) },\n    onVungleAdViewed : function(isComplete) { cc.log(\nonVungleAdViewed\n + isComplete) },\n    onVungleAdReward : function(name) { cc.log(\nreward received:\n + name) }\n})\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n DONOT change your game uiNode in the \nonVungleAdViewed\n or \nonVungleAdReward\n immediately, becase the cocos opengl is disable when \nVungle\n send \nonVungleAdViewed\n or \nonVungleAdReward\n. use \nschedule\n delay change ui.\n\n\nAPI Reference\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginVungle.init();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitialize the plugin instance.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginVungle.show(name);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshow ad with a provided name.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginVungle.setDebug(enable);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenable or disable debug mode.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginVungle.isCacheAvailable();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nis there a cached video available.\n\n\n\n\nsdkbox.PluginVungle.setUserID(userID);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsets the userID for rewarded ads.\n\n\n\n\nListeners\n\n\nonVungleCacheAvailable();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nad cache is available.\n\n\n\n\nonVungleStarted();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVungle is running and available.\n\n\n\n\nonVungleFinished();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVungle is not running/has stopped.\n\n\n\n\nonVungleAdViewed(isComplete);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVungle ad has been viewed.\n\n\n\n\nonVungleAdReward(adName);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfind out which video is reward\n\n\n\n\nManual Integration\n\n\nIf the \nSDKBOX Installer\n \nfails\n to complete successfully, it is possible to integrate SDKBOX manually. If the installer complete successfully, please \ndo not\n complete anymore of this document. It is not necessary.\n\n\nThese steps are listed last in this document on purpose as they are seldom needed.

JSON Configuration  SDKBOX Installer will automatically inject a sample configuration to your  sdkbox_config.json , that you have to modify it before you can use it for your own app  Here is an example of the Vungle configuration, you need to replace  vungle id   with your specific  Vungle  Publisher account information.\nHere is an example adding  Vungle  to iOS:  Vungle  :\n{\n     id : vungle id ,\n     ads :{\n         video :{\n\n        },\n         reward :{\n             incentivized  : true\n        }\n    }\n}   Adding  Vungle  to Android is a bit different as it supports  sound  and backbutton  settings. Here is an example adding  Vungle  to Android:  Vungle  :\n{\n     id : vungle id ,\n     ads :{\n         video :{\n             sound  : true,\n             backbutton  : true\n        },\n         reward :{\n             sound  : false,\n             backbutton  : false,\n             incentivized  : true\n        }\n    }\n}",

Example:\n  \nandroid.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java\n\n\nIn this case, \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n should be located at:\n\n\n../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to add the following imports:\n\n\n\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, modify \nCocos2dxActivity.java\n to edit the \nonCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)\n function to add a call to \nSDKBox.init(this);\n.

If  Application.mk  contains  APP_STL := c++_static , it should be\nchanged to:  APP_STL := gnustl_static  Add \"Assets\" folder  Edit  proj.android/build-cfg.json       copy_resources : [\n        {\n             from :  ../Resources ,\n             to :  \n        },\n        {\n             from :  plugin_youtube_res_project/Assets ,\n             to :  \n        }\n    ]  Copy all source and header files from  plugin/luabindings/  to your projects  Classes  folder.  Add all  .cpp  files, that you just copied, to  Android.mk  in the  LOCAL_SRC_FILES  section.

One way to find the location is to look in  proj.android/project.properties . Example:\n   android.library.reference.1=../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java  In this case,  Cocos2dxActivity.java  should be located at:  ../../cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxActivity.java   Modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to add the following imports:   import android.content.Intent;\nimport com.sdkbox.plugin.SDKBox;   Second, modify  Cocos2dxActivity.java  to edit the  onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState)  function to add a call to  SDKBox.init(this); . The placement of this call is important. It must be done after the call to  onLoadNativeLibraries(); . Example:   onLoadNativeLibraries();\nSDKBox.init(this);    Last, we need to insert the proper  overrides  code. There are a few rules here.    If the method listed has not been defined,  add it .    If the method listed has been defined, add the calls to  SDKBox  in the  same  existing function.          @Override\n    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n          if(!SDKBox.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {\n            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n          }\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n          super.onStart();\n          SDKBox.onStart();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onStop() {\n          super.onStop();\n          SDKBox.onStop();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onResume() {\n          super.onResume();\n          SDKBox.onResume();\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void onPause() {\n          super.onPause();\n          SDKBox.onPause();\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n          if(!SDKBox.onBackPressed()) {\n            super.onBackPressed();\n          }\n    }",
