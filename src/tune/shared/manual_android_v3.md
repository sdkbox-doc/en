### Copy Files
Copy the following __jar__ files from `plugin/android/libs` folder of this
bundle into your project’s __<project_root>/libs__ folder.

> PluginTune.jar

> sdkbox.jar

> MobileAppTracker-3.9.jar


* If you're using cocos2d-x from source copy the __jar__ files to:

	Android command-line:
	```
	cocos2d/cocos/platform/android/java/libs
	```

	Android Studio:
	```
	cocos2d/cocos/platform/android/libcocos2dx/libs
	```

* If you're using cocos2d-js or lua copy the __jar__ files to:

	Android command-line:
	```
	frameworks/cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/java/libs
	```

	Android Studio:
	```
	frameworks/cocos2d-x/cocos/platform/android/libcocos2dx/libs
	```

* If you're using prebuilt cocos2d-x copy the __jar__ files to:

	Android command-line:
	```
	<project_root>/libs
	```

Copy the `plugintune` and `sdkbox` directories from `plugin/android/jni` to your `<project_root>/jni/` directory. If the `sdkbox` folder exists, it's ok to overwrite it.

### Edit `AndroidManifest.xml`
Include the following permissions above the __application tag__:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

To enable __hardware acceleration__ in your __application tag__. This tag is
optional on newer SDK versions and doesn't work on version 2.3.3.
```xml
<android:hardwareAccelerated="true" />
```

It is also necessary to create an __application tag__:
```xml
<application ... >
    <receiver android:name="com.mobileapptracker.Tracker">
        <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="com.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER" />
        </intent-filter>
    </receiver>
    <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.gms.version"
               android:value="@integer/google_play_services_version" />
</application>
```

### Edit `Android.mk`
Edit `<project_root>/jni/Android.mk` to:

Add additional requirements to __LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES__:
```
LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += PluginTune
LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += sdkbox
```

Add a call to:
```
$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))
```
before any __import-module__ statements.

Add additional __import-module__ statements at the end:
```
$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)
$(call import-module, ./plugintune)
```

This means that your ordering should look similar to this:
```
$(call import-add-path,$(LOCAL_PATH))
$(call import-module, ./sdkbox)
$(call import-module, ./plugintune)
```

  __Note:__ It is important to make sure these statements are above the existing `$(call import-module,./prebuilt-mk)` statement, if you are using the pre-built libraries.

### Modify `Application.mk` (Cocos2d-x v3.0 to v3.2 only)
Edit `<project_root>/jni/Application.mk` to make sure __APP_STL__ is defined
correctly. If `Application.mk` contains `APP_STL := c++_static`, it should be
changed to:
```
APP_STL := gnustl_static
```
